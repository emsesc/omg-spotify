101 ContributorsIt Wasn’t Me Lyrics[Intro: Rikrok & Shaggy]
Yo, man
Yo
Open up, man
Yo, what you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You made her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man
I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
How ya fi give the woman access to your villa?
Trespasser and a witness, all the hacklin' a yuh pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killa
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player, you haffi know how fi play
If she say, "A night," convince her, say, "A day"
Never admit to a word weh she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, "Baby, no way!"

Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door

[Bridge: Rikrok]
Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin', it makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player, but you're completely lost
That's why I sing
[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me79Embed

J'revois l'image des huissiers qui voulaient pecho nos TV

Écoute pas leurs pronostics
Te fie pas à l'homme adamique que j'étais quand j'dormais chez les flics
Ils connaîtront ma nouvelle éthique
Mieux vaux la fin d'une chose que son début, la parole me l'explique
Laisse-moi rendre muettes les critiques
Et les remplacer par des phases comme c'est fou c'que ton mari kicke
J'crois encore au Nouveau Mexique
Toi moi et nos kids en laissant l'esprit saint conduire le pick-up
En y allant seul je crois que
J'aurais pas eu cette motivation
Puis sans compter ces pièces pour un pack d'eau
J'aurai pas eu l'envie de nourrir toute une nation
Regard au loin j'vois déjà ton rêve
Pouvoir changer de coiffure tout le temps comme Tyra Banks
Régaler les pauvres au [mam's?] cake à la fraise

She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey
Hey, hey-yeah

And did you miss me while you were
Looking for yourself out there?

My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama
[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

How You Remind Me by Nickelback

66 ContributorsHow You Remind Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of livin' like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

[Post-Chorus]
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

[Verse 2]
It's not like you didn't know that
I said, "I love you," and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you

Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty, stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself, how much I let the fear take the wheel and steer

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there, yeah, ohh

So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine, and hold my own and drive?
Ohh-oh-ohh

That everyone else gets around

[Verse 1: Nelly]
In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home) She can be
18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicy-thicy-thic girl you know that it's on
(You know that it's on) I peep something
Coming towards me on the dance floor, sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
"So when Nelly, can we go?" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34, yelling
"I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there"

Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes

Instead of 'caine now, I got the title from my

Changed now, running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White, c'mon

39 ContributorsIn Too Deep Lyrics[Verse 1]
The faster we're fallin', we're stoppin' and stallin'
We're runnin' in circles again
Just as things were lookin' up, you said it wasn't good enough
But still, we're tryin' one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Stead of goin' under

[Verse 2]
Seems like each time I'm with you, I lose my mind
Because I'm bendin' over backwards to relate
It's one thing to complain, but when you're drivin' me insane
Well then I think it's time that we took a break

Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet

He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down
It was her doom

My head just feels in pain

You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

[Verse 1]
Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', "Could this be real?"
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kind of hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See, this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent, she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through

Last day of the rest of my life
I wish I would've known 'cause I didn't kiss my mama goodbye
I didn't tell her that I loved her, how much I cared
Or thank my pops for all the talks and all the wisdom he shared
Unaware, I just did what I always do
Every day, the same routine before I skate off to school
But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest?
Instead of takin' a test, I took two to the chest
Call me blind, but I didn't see it comin'
Everybody was runnin', but I couldn't hear nothin' except
Gun blasts, it happened so fast
I don't really know this kid, though I sit by him in class
Maybe this kid was reachin' out for love
Or maybe for a moment, he forgot who he was
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was, I know it's because

Little Suzy, she was only twelve
She was given the world with every chance to excel
Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud, but no respect for herself
She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations, just different faces
Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her she deserved much better
Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules so you would think he was cool
He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried, often thought of suicide
It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end, they might remember him then
You cross the line and there's no turning back
Told the world how he felt with the sound of a gat

No matter what you say, it don't take away the pain
That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why, it's the blind leadin' the blind
Guess that's the way the story goes
Will it ever make sense? Somebody's gotta know

Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on (That's right)
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head
[Chorus: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Outro: 2-D]
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

(Get your hands on his cash and)

[Verse 1]
While he was schemin'
I was beamin' in the Beamer just steamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman Marcus on a shopping spree-ah
And on my way, I grabbed Sole and Mia
And as the cashbox rang, I thought everything away

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oops!) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops!) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops!) There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
(Oops!) There goes the house we've made a home
(Oops!) There goes "You'll never leave me alone"
(Oops!) For all the lies you told
This is what you're owed

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

I was coming down the hill just draggin'

And I paid, all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fade away, away

All of the dreams you sold
Left me out in the cold
What happened to the days when we used to trust each other?
And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old
To get 'em back without me
'Cause revenge is better than money, you'll see

And it's been awhile

And it's been awhile
Since I first saw you
And it's been awhile
Since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile
Since I could call you

The consequences that are rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

And it's been awhile
Since I could say that I wasn't addicted
And it's been awhile
Since I can say I love myself as well
And it's been awhile
Since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do
And it's been awhile
But all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile
Since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile
But I can still remember just the way you taste

As fucked up as it all may seem to be, I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

Love Don't Cost a Thing by Jennifer Lopez

27 ContributorsLove Don’t Cost a Thing Lyrics[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 1]
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw the dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast, so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a back street guy
I bet her mama never told her why
I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

And when she knows what
She wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl

You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high-class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice

But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

Uh
Yo, yo, yo, yo

I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (Whoops!)
Aw shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce! Come on, bounce!
*Gunshots* I said come on, bounce!
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (Me!)
Not weed, I meant coke; dumb-ass, sit down! (Oh)
We don't bullshit, better ask around

Yeah, I took 'em all, dawg, with some Parmesan
And I think my arm is gone — No, it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary-ass, it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Well, stop actin' stupid; you so high
That you might wake up with a guy on some new shit
Yeah, I think I did too much (Huh-uh)
This substance equals cuffs (Huh-uh)

[Verse 3: Proof & Bizarre]
Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the Hulk
I wanna roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray look for dope to smoke?
No? Okey-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke
(*Coughing*) Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ah, poor baby, born by a whore lady
Now I gotta strangle an {infant} (You're crazy!)

I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine

We can't get jobs, 'cause our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack, then I might too
(Swift, chill!) I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue (Huh-uh)
Speed, shrooms, down the Valiums (Huh-uh)
Even smoke weed out of vacuums
I just copped some and I'm goin' back soon

My appetite for loving is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feeling sexy, who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is their insecurity

When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor

So when life get hot in July, it's the world against you and I

There you were freaking out
Trying to get your head around
The fact that me and you and love is dead
See how I'm tripping out
'Cause you can't decide what you really want from me

Why does it have to be like this?

'Cause you make me love you, love you, baby

There you were shouting out
Cranking up your altercations, getting upset in your desperation
Screamin' and hollerin'
How could this love become so paper-thin?
You're playing so hard to get
You're making me sweat just to hold your attention
I can't give you nothing more
If you ain't giving nothing to me
Don't you know that

[Chorus]
You make me love you, love you baby
With a little L
Why does it have to be like this?

Of my broken shell

Ladies and gentlemen, let's put our hands together for this dynasty
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
To the eighth wonder of the world
The flow of the century
Always timeless
Hov
Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
I appreciate that
Uh

[Verse 1]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese, I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof, vamoose, son of a bitch

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let 'em know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady, it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raisin' the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks

[Verse 3]
Yeah, Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack (Yeah)
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets busy

Fill Me In by Craig David

I got something to say, got something to say
Alright (Can you fill me in?)
Come on
Can you fill me in?
What you want? What you want me to do, baby?
Can you fill me in?
Let's talk about it

[Verse 1]
I was checkin' this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned, said, "Hey boy, come on right around"
So I knock at the door
You were standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean, me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, "Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?"
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (It's another one, it's another one)
You might also like[Verse 2]
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, "Hey girl, come on right around"
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean, me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, "Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door"
Can you fill me in? (Fill me in)
Wearing a jacket, whose property?
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (Can you tell me?)
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)
[Bridge]
All they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby
(Craig David)
Watchin' our every move
Think someday they might approve, baby

[Chorus]
"Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)"
Calls diverted to answer phone

Turn Off The Light by Nelly Furtado

26 ContributorsTurn Off the Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say, "Woe is me" instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me, "You're better off alone"

[Pre-Chorus]
But after midnight
Morning will come
And the day will see
If you will get some

[Chorus]
They say, "That girl, ya know, she act too tough, tough, tough
Well, it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say, "That girl, you know, she act so rough, rough, rough
Well, it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say, "Follow me, follow me, follow me down
Down, down, down
'Til you see all my dreams"
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

[Verse 2]
I looked above the other day
'Cause I think I'm good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon (By the moon)
If it's high, play it low
If it's harvest, go slow
And if it's full, then go

Plus we hit it off like first sight in "Love Jones"
Been in, many zones, baby love it all hate it all
From, prissy women to women who go to shadows
But you know, the Rule be livin' it up
And got all y'all, givin' it up
I like a, little ooh baby, how cute are you?
With a body that rides on sexual
I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
Do a doughnut, and cut, then I'll open it up
On the freeway, hand on the wheel, foot on the clutch
Rule baby, not givin' it up
[Hook: Case & Ja Rule]
What, do I do?
To everybody that be livin it up, we say
What, I do
And all my ladies that be givin it up, uhh
What, you do
To everybody that be livin' it up, we say
What, do I do?
And all my ladies that be givin it up, uhh
My love's for you
C'mon

[Bridge: Ja Rule]
C'mon, we get right
C'mon, we get live
C'mon, we get right
Live yo' life

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Love you so sexy, I just want you next to me
Your whole vibe, like you high on ecstasy
Cause it ain't nuttin' but an 'Inc' thang, bay-bay
I know the pussy wet like crazy
I wanna, feel your passion, come when you askin'
Laugh when you cryin', cry when you laughin
But ain't nothing happenin', a girl got a little uptight
Turned off the light and then started crashin'
The radio blastin' "Between Me and You"
But, you ain't on the low with that freaky thing you do
Girl I thought you knew (what I do), know I know
(what you do)
Cause it ain't a good night if you don't ain't right
Like, Teddy P let's "Turn Off the Lights"
And, grind it out, takin' no times out
'til the sun come out, let me find out
[Hook: Case & Ja Rule]
What, do I do?
To everybody that be livin it up, we say
What, I do
And all my ladies that be givin it up, uhh
What, you do
To everybody that be livin' it up, we say
What, do I do?
And all my ladies that be givin it up, uhh
My love's for you
C'mon

To everybody that be livin it up, we say

And all my ladies that be givin it up, uhh
What, you do
To everybody that be livin it up, we say

Ain't It Funny by Jennifer Lopez

21 ContributorsAin’t It Funny Lyrics[Intro]
Estoy
Loca
Enamorada
De ti

[Verse 1]
It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind (In my mind)
I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance (Ooh)
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?
You might also like[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be (Never be)
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me (Ooh)
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about (You're about)
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt (Ooh)
You've touched my heart, and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

[Bridge]
I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be (Ooh)
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be
[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life  (Oh, yeah)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No, no)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart? (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even though you try)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life?
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right?
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?4Embed

Missing You by Case

10 ContributorsMissing You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Standing here lookin' out my window
My nights are long and my days are cold 'cause I don't have you
How can I be so damn demanding?
I know you said that it's over now but I can't let go

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day, I want to pick up the phone
And tell you that
You're everything I need and more
If only I could find you

Like a cold summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you
I'm the desert without the sand
You're the woman without a man
I'm a ring without a hand
I'm missing you

My rear-view mirror's playing tricks on me 'cause you fade away
Maybe I'm just hallucinating

Baby
Uh-uh
Let me explain to you what I'm sayin'
What you sayin'?
It's not even like that
It wasn't like that, but I saw you!
Baby I don't love her
You don't love me! You know what I don't even want to talk to you
She don't mean nothing to me!
I don't even want to see ya face
She was just telling me...
I just want to see you walking through that door
Baby, don't-
There ain't nothing else to say
Why we gotta do it like this?
Peace!
Baby...DAMN!

[Verse 1]
Come home late it seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gonna get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
So If you want some loving I suggest you go back there
Where you came from
You might also likeDay to day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve God knows that I don't deserve
What you put me through cause I been so true to you
For you to come at me with another lame excuse

[Chorus]
See I
Heard it all before
(Heard it all before)
All of ya lies, all of ya sweet talk
Baby this, baby that
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down

Played the fool before
(Played the fool before)
I was your fool I believed in you
Yes I did, yes I did
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down
(I had to shut you down)

[Verse 2]
What were you thinking bringing her into our home
In our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head
Messing up my sheets and violating me
Have me 'bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets
Nothing you can do and there's nothing you can say
That could persuade me to stay with you another day
You have crossed the line to the point of no return
What you do from here on out, I am no longer concerned

[Chorus]
See I
Heard it all before
(Heard it all before)
"Let me explain, baby, it's not what you think"
That's what you said to me

Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down

I used to hang on to your every word (every word)
But the more you lie to me the more I hurt (mmm)
The things you use to say would sound so sweet
(Sound so sweet)
I was naive quick to believe
[Chorus]
I heard it all before
"I was at work, it wasn't my car you saw
Baby, I swear it wasn't me!"
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down

You were my boo, I trusted you
For way too long (Way too long)
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down

You got to know you messed up
You got to go now
Say what you want (Say what you want)
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down

There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange, mmm
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

[Pre-Chorus 1: Justin with All]
Was it something I said
To make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold?
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind

I'm Already There by Lonestar

16 ContributorsI’m Already There Lyrics[Verse 1]
He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say "I love you" one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughin' in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
He said, "Daddy, when you coming home?"
He said the first thing that came to his mind

[Chorus 1]

I know that it's over
But I can't believe we're through
They said that time's a healer
And I'm better without you
It's gonna take time I know
But I'll get over you

Look at my life
Look at my heart
I have seen them fall apart
Now I'm ready to rise again
Just look at my hopes
Look at my dreams
I'm building bridges from these scenes
Now I'm ready to rise again

So here we stand in our secret place
Where the sound of the crowd is so far away
You take my hand, and it feels like home
We both understand, it's where we belong

[Verse 2]
So how do I say, do I say goodbye?
We both have our dreams, we both wanna fly
So let's take tonight, to carry us through
The lonely times

[Chorus]
I'll always look back as I walk away
This memory will last for eternity
And all of our tears will be lost in the rain
When I find my way back to your arms again
But until that day, you know you are
The queen of my heart
The queen of my heart

[Verse 3]
So let's take tonight and never let go
While dancing we'll kiss, like there's no tomorrow
As the stars sparkle down, like a diamond ring
I'll treasure this moment 'til we meet again

So many things I've got to tell you
But I'm afraid I don't know how

From then on I knew that by you being in my life
Things were destined to change 'cause

Wanting you
Hoping for the chance to get to know you
Longing for your kiss
For your touch, your feel, your Presence
Many nights I've cried from the things you do
Felt like I could die from the thought of losing you
I know that you're real

No More Drama by Mary J. Blige

18 ContributorsNo More Drama Lyrics[Intro]
So tired, tired of this drama
You go your way, I go my way
No more, no more
I'd rather be free
So tired, tired, tired

[Verse 1]
Broken heart again
Another lesson learn
Better know your friends
Or else you will get burned
Gotta count on me
'Cause I can guarantee that I'll be fine

[Chorus]
(No more pain)
No more pain
(No more pain)
No more pain
(No drama)
No more drama in my life
(No more in my life) No one's gonna make me hurt again

[Verse 2]
Why'd I play the fool?
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress
'Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

Ooh, it feels so good
When you let go
Of all the drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain (Free from all the pain)
Free from all the game (Free from all the game)
Free from all the stress (Free from all the stress)
So find your happiness
I don't know
Only God knows where the story ends for me
But I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whether we win or lose
And I choose to win

Get your oil changed, I check fluids and transmission
You one minute fools, you wonder why y'all missin'
On the back of milk cartons and there's no reward
No regards, close, but it's no cigar
A hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last
I jump in pools and make a big splash
Water overflowin', so get your head right
It's all in your mind, punk, so keep your head tight
Enough with tips and advice and thangs
I'm big dog, havin' women seein' stripes and thangs
They go to sleep, start snorin', countin' sheep and shit
They so wet that they body start to leak and shit
Just 'cause I'm a all-nighter, shoot all fire
Ludacris, balance and rotate all tires

I don't want no minute man
