I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies
It's on and poppin tonight 'cause it's meant to be ours
We keep a fadeaway shot

Love Story by Taylor Swift

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said

[Chorus]
"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'"

I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me

Everybody ride her, just like a bus route

And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight

Walking on a dream
How can I explain?
Talking to myself
Will I see again?

We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

Is it real now?
Two people become one

Two people become one

Living in a rhythm where the minute's working over time

Monster by Skillet

74 ContributorsMonster Lyrics[Verse 1]
The secret side of me
I never let you see
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
So stay away from me
The beast is ugly
I feel the rage, and I just can't hold it
It's scratching on the walls
In the closet, in the halls
It comes awake, and I can't control it
Hiding under the bed
In my body, in my head
Why won't somebody come and save me from this?
Make it end!

[Chorus]
I feel it deep within!
It's just beneath the skin!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I hate what I've become!
The nightmare's just begun!
I must confess that I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!
I, I feel like a monster!

[Verse 2]
My secret side I keep
Hid under lock and key
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
'Cause if I let him out
He'll tear me up, break me down
Why won't somebody come and save me from this?
Make it end!

With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Woah)

Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on

They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away

Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble, she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers

Paranoia is in bloom, the PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)

[Verse 2]
Another promise, another seed
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
And we will be victorious

Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick a switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die

I need another story
Something to get off my chest

From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

S.O.S, she's in disguise
S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

[Verse 1]
A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office (Uh)
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you about it

[Chorus]
There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way

To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys
I just want to enjoy (Uh)
By having a very good time
And behave very bad in the arms of a boy

[Chorus]
There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business

Ain't no question who about to kill 'em

And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, "What?" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention

I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

Back into the game and they know

You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save

He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
We're all alone
Smokin' his last cigarette
I said, "Where you been?"
He said, "Ask anything"
Where were you
When everything was fallin' apart?
Where all my days
Were spent by a telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad

Surrounded, surrounded

The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of, to free his mind in search of

Bulletproof by La Roux

Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won't let you in again
The messages I've tried to send
My information's just not going in
Burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap
Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

[Chorus]
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof

[Verse 2]
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead
Do-do-do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt

Mmm, nobody's talkin'
'Cause talkin' just turns into screamin', oh

And what's even worse, that we don't
Even remember why we're fighting

I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

[Verse 2]
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
You might also like[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies

Haven't Met You Yet by Michael Bublé

I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up, then I let myself down

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility

[Chorus]
And I know some day that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

Lisztomania by Phoenix

40 ContributorsLisztomania Lyrics[Verse 1]
So sentimental
Not sentimental, no
Romantic, not disgusting yet
Darling, I'm down and lonely
When with the fortunate only
I've been looking for something else
Do let, do let, do let
Jugulate, do let, do
Let's go slowly, discouraged
Distant from other interests
On your favorite weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only
That's with the fortunate only
No, I gotta be someone else
These days, it comes, it comes, it comes
It comes, it comes and goes
[Chorus]
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Not easily offended
Not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses

Follow, misguide, stand still
Disgust, discourage
On this precious weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only
Wealthiest gentlemen only
And now that you're lonely
Do let, do let, do let
Jugulate, do let, do
Let's go slowly, discouraged
We'll burn the pictures instead
When it's all over, we can barely discuss
For one minute only
Not with the fortunate only
Thought it could have been something else
These days, it comes, it comes, it comes
It comes, it comes and goes

The Climb by Miley Cyrus

64 ContributorsThe Climb Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
"You'll never reach it"
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost with no direction
My faith is shaken

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

[Chorus]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

The chances I'm taking

If Today Was Your Last Day by Nickelback

27 ContributorsIf Today Was Your Last Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride
(What if, what if?)

[Chorus 1]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have?
(What if, what if?)
If today was your last day
(What if, what if?)
(If today was your last day)

[Verse 2]
Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?

Let nothin' stand in your way (Way)

All up in the blogs saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's

And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping

Ooh whoa oh, oh
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows

She had a shiny little Beamer with the ragtop down
Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barkin' and a-waggin' around
And I just laughed and said "Y'all get in"

[Verse 2]
She had on a new dress and she'd curled her hair
She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do, baby, I don't care
We can go to the show, or we can stay right here

[Chorus]
And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Oh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And oh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, bullet hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess

Coulda been dead lookin' back at it

But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
'Cause I hit you, and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

See where we could be if we press fast forward
Just one more round, if you’re down, I'm pourin'

Fill another cup up, feelin' on your butt, what
You don't even care now, I was unaware how
Fine you was before my buzz set in

Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone

Couple more shots, you open up like a book

So I made her say "ah, ah-ah"
Now she got her hand on my leg
Got my seats all wet in my ride (All wet in my ride)

Then my pants got bigger, she already knew what to figure
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, "Fuck that nigga!"

Welcome to The E.N.D
Do not panic, there is nothing to fear
Everything around you is changing
Nothing stays the same

Tomorrow, I will be different
The energy never dies
Energy cannot be destroyed, or created
It always is, and it always will be
This is the end, and the beginning..
Forever infinite

Let It Rock by Kevin Rudolf, Lil Wayne

48 ContributorsLet It Rock Lyrics[Intro: Electronic Voice]
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

[Verse 1: Kevin Rudolf]
I see your dirty face, hide behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God to justify the way
You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well, you made your bed
I made mine

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

[Verse 2: Kevin Rudolf]
Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father
When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart, so he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well, you'll get what's yours
I got mine
You might also like[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeoaw!
Wayne's World, Planet Rock
Panties drop, and the tops
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela
(Rock!) And Pamela
(Rock!) And Samantha
(Rock!) And Amanda
And Tamara, ménage à moi
I'm in here like, "Bitch, what's up?"
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up, I can dick you down
Shorty, we can go wherever, just pick a town
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big-ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground
Weezy

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Just let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I'm back like I forgot somethin', I'm somethin'
Ruling rock rubbin' rap running
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect, I'll bang ya
Period, like the reminder

[Outro: Kevin Rudolf]
And I wish I could be as cruel as you
And I wish I could say the things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No, not this time21Embed

You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler than the flip-side of my pillow,  that's right
Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me
It lets me know that it's okay (Yeah, it's okay)
And the moments when my good times start to fade

[Chorus]
You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

[Verse 2]
Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never, never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-nooo!"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See, I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose

See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line?

But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin', keep the loving goin'
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose

And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside, but between us, it's worse in here

But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

Slipping through our fingers

To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of

The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

I go, "Ooh-ooh", you go, "Ah, ah"
La-la-la-la, a-la-la-la
I can't lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
I wanna, wanna, wanna get, get, get what I want
Don't stop
Gimme, gimme, gimme what you got, got
'Cause I can't wait, wait, wait anymore, more, more, more
Don't even talk about the consequence
'Cause right now, you're the only thing that's making any sense to me
And I don't give a damn what they say, what they think, think
'Cause you're the only one who's on my mind
I'll never ever let you leave me
I'll try to stop time forever, never wanna hear you say goodbye (Goodbye)

[Chorus]
I feel so untouched
And I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now
Need you so much
Somehow I can't forget you
Been going crazy from the moment I met you

To live, live the way you gotta, gotta live your life
Gimme, gimme, gimme all of you, you
Don't be scared
I'll see you through the loneliness of wanting more, more, more
Don't even think about what's right or wrong, or wrong or right
'Cause in the end, it's only you and me
And no one else is gonna be around
To answer all the questions left behind
And you and I are meant to be
So even if the world falls down today
You've still got me to hold you up, up
And I will never let you down (Down)

Take a breath, take it deep
"Calm yourself", he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I'm sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps"
And then I get a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

Guess who? D'you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby) (Yeah)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
"Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!"
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can, Ken, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But, Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a two; you're practically a ten
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley-horse her
Sorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim
[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)

And that's why, my love
You'll never live without
I know you want me, girl
'Cause I can see you checking me out
And, baby, you know
You know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby
I'm the only one for you (*fart*)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
"Lord, help us, he's back in his pink ALF shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!"
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl
[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)

Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day there'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me
Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same
Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave, I have to live
I had to lead, I had to live

I'm Not Alone - Radio Edit by Calvin Harris

4 ContributorsI’m Not Alone (Radio Edit) LyricsCan you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold

You cannot dream yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
For next year

God, I can't do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door

I'm not alone

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

I've been spending all my time
Just thinking 'bout you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you

[Bridge]
Oh, I just can't take it
My heart is racing
The emotions keep spinning out

[Chorus]
I've been spending all my time
Just thinking 'bout you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you
[Outro]
I think I'm fallin' for you
I can't stop thinking 'bout it
I want you all around me
And now I just can't hide it
I think I'm fallin' for you
I can't stop thinking 'bout it
I want you all around me
And now I just can't hide it
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you
Oh, oh, no, no
Oh, oh, I'm fallin' for you8Embed

In For The Kill by La Roux

17 ContributorsIn for the Kill Lyrics[Verse 1]
We can fight our desires
(Ooh) But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot
(Ooh) Whether we like it or not
They say we can love who we trust
(Ooh) But what is love without lust?
Two hearts with accurate devotions
(Ooh) What are feelings without emotions?

[Chorus]
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Verse 2]
I hang my hopes out on the line
(Ooh) Well they'd be ready for you in time
If you leave them out too long
(Ooh) They'll be withered by the sun
Full stops and exclamation marks (Ah-ah)
(Ooh) My words stumble before I start
How far can you send emotions? (Ooh-ooh)
(Ooh) Can this bridge cross the ocean?

And not let go of my hand
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Bridge]
Let's go to war to make peace
Let's be cold to create heat
I hope in darkness we can see
And you're not blinded by the light from me

[Interlude]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand1Embed

When Love Takes Over (feat. Kelly Rowland) by David Guetta, Kelly Rowland

1 ContributorWhen Love Takes Over Lyrics(David Guetta feat. Kelly Rowland)
It's complicated... it always is
That's just the way it goes
Feels like I've waited so long for this
I wonder if it shows
Head under water, now I can't breathe
It never felt so good
'Cause I can feel it coming over me
I wouldn't stop it if I could
When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something's here tonight
Give me a reason... I gotta know
Do you feel it too?
Can't you see me here on overload
And this time I blame you
Mmmm lookin' out for you to hold my hand
Feels like I could fall
Now love me right like I know you can
We could loose it all
When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something's here tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
And I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I will be loving you all the time... it's true
'Cause I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I love the way you make me cry... I do
When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over

Over... over... over... over... over...
Over... over... over, over, over
When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny

I Love College by Asher Roth

55 ContributorsI Love College Lyrics[Intro]
('Cause I ain't going out like a sucka, no way)
I'm nice right now man
I-I feel good
If you have a drink, would you please put it in the air?

[Chorus]
That party last night was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

[Verse 1]
I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Banker's Club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup, let's get fucked up (Let's get fucked up!)
I'm next on the table, who want what
I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it, otherwise, you naked
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is, um

That party last night was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (I wish we taped it)

Go out to eat, then do it again

[Bridge]
Man, I love college (Hey!)
And I love drinking (Hey!)
I love women (Hey!)
Man, I love college (Hey!)

[Verse 2]
I can't tell you what I learned from school
But, I could tell you a story or two
Um, yeah, of course, I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'till the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is
[Chorus]
That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (I wish we taped it)
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again

[Bridge]
Man, I love college (Hey!)
And I love drinking (Hey!)
I love women (Hey!)
I love college (Hey!)

[Interlude]
Now if everybody would please
Put their drink, as high as they can
As high as they can, and repeat after me
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Freshmen! Freshmen!

Do something crazy! Do something crazy!

Man I love college, I love it
(That party last night)
Goodnight everybody
I gotta head back to class for a little bit
[Chorus]
That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (You know what's going on)
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed (You are all invited)
But my good friends is all I need (Bring your friends)
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

Do I really have to graduate, or can I just stay here for the rest of my life?

[Outro]
But after that
You know what's goin' down
My house and 3 kegs
See you there, you're all invited
Bring your friends, bring your mom
Do I really have to graduate
Or can I just stay here the rest of my life?44Embed

You already know what it is (ah)
We got another one boy (A-T-L, yeah)

What's up Brooklyn? What's up son?
What's up Fabo?
Aye man (oh...), I got that black AmEx with me
A.K.A. that "Throw It In The Bag" card
Radio Killa (Yeah)

[Verse 1 - The-Dream]
Now I know you ain't over there staring at my girl
Yeah, I know you ain't over there staring at my girl
Nigga, I know you don't call yourself hollering at my girl
Now I know you don't call yourself hollering at my girl
I keep her in Louboutin, Louis Vuitton
Gucci down to her feet, yup, just like me
I'm the one, with them ones
Fuck the price on the tag, just throw it in the bag

[Hook - The-Dream & Fabolous]
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh (Ladies, y'all ready to go shopping?)

Look at price tags, where they do that at?
Heard that in A-T-L, when I'm in A-T-L
Just ask my baby gal, I treat that lady well
Ain't nothing so-so, and I know J.D. well
A couple Benzes, black, white, gray C.L
Got niggas looking like, "Did we miss a Mercedes sale?"
Don't wonder what I do, just know they pay me well
They keep that Gucci and that Louis on my labi-el's
That's the way we feel -- must be nice, man
You with the right man, you ain't gotta price scan
Or ask how much, now what I look like?
Son I'm from Brooklyn -- what it look like?
You get it cause I got it, I got it so you get it
In Miami they say, "Don't stop, get it, get it"
Mami do the Speedy, daddy do the duffle
Bag full of chips, we ain't talking Ruffles

[Hook- The-Dream]
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

[Verse 3 - Fabolous with The-Dream]
See, I know what I'mma tell her
The same thing that the bank robber told the teller --
Just throw it in the bag
That's the way it supposed to be
A real nigga 'posed to help you out with the groceries
Just throw it in the bag
Paper or plastic, it's safer to ask it
So dead that nigga, I will pay for the casket
That Remy Mar' got him spitting plenty bars
Broke ass nigga, couldn't buy the mini bar
So get with Loso, he ain't got to know so
Such a gentleman, dozen bottles of that Rose Mo'
Oh you got a man? Well, you need a richer one
Meet me in the parking lot, the plates say "GET U 1"
Meet me at the register, I'm there on the regular
Them niggas price checking, you can help them in a second
As we proceed to give you what you need
Like we breaking down the weed
Shorty, throw it in the bag

Holiday by Dizzee Rascal

9 ContributorsHoliday Lyrics[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Get your passport and your bikini
You need a holiday, come see me
I know you're tired of the same old scenery
And I could change all that so easily
Don't worry 'bout a thing, girl, take a chance
I'll take you to the south of France
Like Cannes, and if anybody can, I can
We could both shop in the Milan
I just hope you understand
I hope you see it clear
It really don't matter how far or near
'Cause there's no distance
That could stop my persistence
Just a few days of the year
Plus I've got clout, so let's ride out
We ain't gotta fly, we can just drive out
We can have a rave or we can hide out
Won't tell nobody, let them find out

[Chorus: Chrome]
If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby

Don't watch my passport photo, I know I look a bit loco
And I know that my Spanish is so-so
But let's try keep that on the low-low
Cause we're going Ibiza
I've got friends that really wanna meet ya
With champagne and a whole lot of reefa
It's all good darling, a Blue Marlin will please ya
And I'll never let your belly get empty
Even when your belly full you're still sexy
We can ride speed boats, we can ride jet skis
I'll show you the time of your life if you let me
I just want to put a smile on your pretty face
If I didn't it would just be your pretty waste
You do look like a girl with a bit of taste
So I couldn't take you just any place

[Chorus: Chrome]
If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]
I know you're really busy and I know you got plans
But are you really too busy for a sun tan?
I ain't talking about walking down the high street
I'm talking about laying on a bright white beach
With a Pina Colada or whatever you'd rather
White wine, that's fine, just give me a lager
Then after we'll take a truck to the night spot
The hot spot, the top spot, party around the clock
And when we get there it's strictly VIP
No need for ID, security know me
No waiting in line, no high entry fee
Don't worry about nothing when you're beside me
I'll get you lively and loosen you up
Have a bit of champagne, it'll boost you up
I wanna move you up, I wanna take you away
So have a word, darling, what do you say?

[Chorus: Chrome]
If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, babyEmbed
