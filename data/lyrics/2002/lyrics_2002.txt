Dilemma by Nelly, Kelly Rowland

13 ContributorsAlter Ego 2 Lyrics[Intro - Black Kent et Sifoor]
BK "- Han han yeah, on m'entend ou quoi ?
S. - T’inquiète poto
BK - Ok, j'fais un test
S. - Vas-y
BK - Écoute."

Micro check faya, on fout l'fire pour qu'nos foules flambent
On n'attend pas la fin du calendrier Maya
Qu'ils tournent la page comme Saya
Au cœur du zion, c'est l'œil du tigre et le cœur du lion

[Refrain]
Tu viens du bled, poto poto viens m'check
Si tu veux des bords y'a pas photo viens m'check
Tu viens de Paname ou de Bordeaux viens m'check
Si tu pètes un ble-ca sur ce morceau viens m'check

[Couplet 1 - Sifoor]
J’écris des textes à raison et à tort
Si l'on pouvait évaluer la valeur de mes dires j'aurais déjà la bouche en or
Petit, le Monde va mal et ils en rient du Darfour à Paris
Le mot "hardcore" passe de l'euphémisme à euphorie
2012, la concurrence va morfler
Leurs rêves deviennent cauchemars depuis qu'Sifoor a cané Morphée
Ils prient qu'on m'supprime
Quand j'rappe leurs flows font tache
Comme une Clio dans un parking de Carlos Slim
Je te bédave sec et c'n'est que préliminaire
Clébard tu fais le chaud moi je t'endors comme un vétérinaire
Tu prends des cocards d'un tocard qu't'insultes tout le temps
Après ce son j't'imagine gazé comme Coca
Gros spliff, yeux rouges, Jimmy Cliff
Ma clique sait qu'j'ai la clef pour tout niquer comme un préservatif
Tu fais le chaud toi t'es le futur roi
Tu suffoques dans nos flows, j'ai jamais vu de dauphins qui se noient

[Couplet 2 - Black Kent]
C'est l'blédard t'as pas du capter
Reçu 5 sur 5 comme si y'avait les Jackson 5 sur Arte
Dès qu'j'opère c'est d'la purée qu'je lâche, là t'as les deux offerts
Les feux au vert j'viens de brûler The Mask
Rendre fière la mater' c'est beau, on alterne entre haltères et plume
V'là les sales frères sur Alter ego
Old school Black, j'viens tout baiser avec mes Tim comme Justin
Et à la fin si c'est moi l'père c'est beau
Timbo Timbo quand j'disais Team
Elle est ptêt clean mais plate comme les semelles de vieilles Team
Mon ex-team a dit au ptit gars "oust", à présent suis moi j'pousse
Les phases rares comme une chinoise rousse
Les chiennes aboient passe la caravane, v'là ma carabine 'braah'
Petit on abat pas l'shériff à l'aide d'une sarbacane
Yeah, j'reste debout quitte à m'mettre à l'aise
Si j'm'assois c'est sur le trône ou au Père Lachaise
[Refrain]

Eh yo c'est Black black hello (hello)

Without Me by Eminem

448 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolTürkçePortuguês日本語Italianoहिन्दीDeutschFrançaisفارسیDanskWithout Me Lyrics[Intro: Obie Trice]
Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks
Ra—, *record scratch*

[Refrain 1: Eminem]
Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Woo! (Ooh, ooh)

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
(Da-da-da, da, da, da, da, da, da)
(Da-da-da, da, da, da, da)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie!)
You might also like[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!"
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, "Attention, please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talkin', "This shit, that shit"
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Who will be there to take my place?

To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

And fall upon us all

Who can bring me back to you

You're a song written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong
'Cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them

There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong to each other

Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But you see the colors in me
Like no one else

And you need some discipline
But lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And you give me the most gorgeous sleep

It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

Till I Collapse by Eminem, Nate Dogg

386 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolTürkçePortuguêsItalianoहिन्दीFrançaisPolskiEminem - ´Till I Collapse ft. Nate Dogg (Svensk Översättning)’Till I Collapse Lyrics[Intro: Eminem]
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo, left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo, left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo, left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(Until the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Until my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Give out from underneath me)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

[Verse 2]
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

[Verse 3]
Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

[Pre-Chorus 1]
White heat is screamin' in the jungle (Oh, oh-oh)
Complete the motion if you stumble (Oh-oh)
Go ask the dust for any answers (Oh-oh)
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

[Chorus]
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?

He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

[Chorus]
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to Earth

[Verse 2]
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feedin' the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along and stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now

Too bad that you couldn't see
I see the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?

I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever

Out across the endless sea
I will die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

Elle peut être de type bureau ou affectionner le strip-tease
Meuf tu m’émoustilles quand tu me regardes dans les yeux
Mais tu parles trop, j'te jure tu me fais descendre perché
Je ne veux pas perdre cette sensation parce-que, ma tête est en émoi
C'est en feu et t'as l’air prête à recevoir
Je suis, un vagabond, que ce sot sous une capuche ou une toile de lin
Un pourvoyeur, je dois voir des bijoux sur mes femmes
Et je, j'en profite, le Squad reste emplissant le 4x4
Avec des gonzesses qui veulent faire une virée avec nous, uh
Tu dis que tu as un homme et que tu es amoureuse
Mais qu'est-ce que l'amour a à voir avec un petit ménage à trois
Après la petite sauterie, toi et moi
Je pourrais juste glisser pour un instant et elle pourrais jouir aussi

Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go

Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)
[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!
[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama

U Got It Bad by USHER

48 ContributorsU Got It Bad Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ooh

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

[Chorus]
(You) You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone (Oh, yeah), hang up and you call right back
(Oh, you) You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (You can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her, "I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
Ladies, say, "I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can"

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad (Hey, hey, no, no)
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, ha, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track (Yeah)
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house (Oh, you're stuck)
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about (Look at yourself)
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else (Somebody)
You got it bad
[Electric Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else32Embed

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

[Verse 1]
Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
Get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail

Not on strike but I'm about to bowl one

She Hates Me by Puddle Of Mudd

32 ContributorsShe Hates Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued

[Pre-Chorus]
In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

[Chorus]
She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

[Verse 2]
She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt
No feeling of bad, no

Yeah, is that bounce right here
Time to move on, time to be strong
Don't stop now, straight to the top now
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 1: Diddy & Ginuwine]
Girl, you made me believe again
If you happy, then be with him
Go 'head, mami, breathe again, go 'head, mami, breathe again
Don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head, mami, make it hot now
I need me a love that's gon' make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I been through
And how I had a triflin' mental
So ride with me, G Force, fly with me
Times get hard, cry with me, die with me
White beach sands, lie with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
(This is what I need) So tight, now I understand life

Is a pretty woman next to me (A pretty woman, yeah, baby)

Maybe we could start a family (Start a family, baby)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 2: Loon with Mario Winans &  Diddy]
Listen to me now, what should I say now? Come on, ma
Been a whole day, now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime, you'd be a crook to me
'Cause mami, I done been around the world
Seen a lot of places
Been around your girl, believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me to prevail
But I learn my lesson watchin' Sean stressin'
So why listen to her and start guessin'?
Mami, you ain't ready to ride then start dressin'
I need a girl to receive my mom's blessin'
Confession, my love no contestin'
I need affection
Yes, I need affection, let's go Mario
[Bridge: Mario Winans]
Girl, what the hell is on your mind?
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's something leakin' in your mind
Don't look too good for you and me
Always getting weak
That ain't what I need, baby

[Chorus: Mario Winans with Ginuwine]
Is a pretty woman next to me (Oh, please, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (I need a girl in my life)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family baby)
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man (How to treat a man)
This is what I need

[Verse 3: Diddy]
Ayo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as we're here, then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that'll last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put stress to rest girl, stop the games
Name the spot, mami, I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the Range
Ma, I got some thangs, known to put rocks in rings
Pushing hundred-foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to Saint-Tropez
Or seen a brotha play a Mandolay?
Girl, I wanna just look in your eyes and watch the sunrise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', you, I believe in
Love you 'til the day I stop breathing
I love you, girl
[Outro: Mario Winans & Ginuwine]
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
A pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
Oh yeah, oh yeah
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need baby
Is a pretty woman next to me
Standing next to me
To share the dreams that I believe

Throw it up, baby, it's Brick City, you heard of that

I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around

Well, the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Feelin' ready, lookin' fine

With the magic in his eyes
Checkin' every girl in sight
Groovin' like he does the mambo

He's the king bailando el ritmo ragatanga
And the DJ that he knows well
On the spot always around twelve
Plays the mix that Diego mezcla con la salsa
Y la baila and he dances y la canta

Somethin' Stupid by Robbie Williams, Nicole Kidman

19 ContributorsSomethin’ Stupid LyricsI know I stand in line until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid
Like "I love you"

I can see it in your eyes you still despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true
And never seemed so right before

I practice every day to find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red
And, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid
Like "I love you"

The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red
And, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid
Like "I love you"

'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyein' me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids

Name a nigga in the league got more game than me

And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness

Swine on the dash, G-wagon is so fly

When it come to these cars I am that nigga

Turn around and sit it down and let 'em bite your butt
See the steerin' wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani
With your baby momma, player's where you can find me
Cruisin' through the parkin' lot on twenty-fours
Cadillac Escalade with the chromed-out nose
With an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot (Turn left)
Where your wife really love me 'cause the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, start the 3-wheel Benz (Skrtt)
Hyper white lights, ultra-violet lens
Sumitomo tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the horn go, (Uh uh) boy can you top that
I'ma show you some shit, rookie, press that button
The trunk went "uh-uh", and all of a sudden

In a Cadillac truck twenty-fours with tens
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
Six bad broads flyin' in at nine
New Suburban truck with the porno showin'
Up and down and up they goin'
Bodies on the Roadster, Lexus, you know what
That hard-top Bimmer, yo Ma, that's your truck
I'm comin' up, the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up to bubbly
430 Lex with the convertible top
And the rims keeps spinning every time I stop
Got a Superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a old school Caddy with a diamond in the back

It's wanting what you've got

Just a Friend 2002 - Radio Edit by Mario

7 Contributors13/08/2017: Oxxxymiron vs. Slava KPSS (English Translation) Lyrics[Intro]
– Ayo, introduce yourself
– Slava KPSS
– Yeeea. Slavik, what's up with this interesting merch of yours?
– That's Antihype merch. You're gonna see the fall of Tower of Babel, like on Bruegel's painting. I've got 56 types of weed in me, just like in my yeger's flask. Yeeeeah man
– Strange question, but what's your opponent's name?
– Tick-tock-boom, tiki-tiki-ti-punk, steampunk, bitch! That's how we're gonna call him
– Thoughts on this event? Your opinion on the battle of different battle leagues? Predictions on the result?
– My only prediction is 4:0, like in the match between SKA-Energia and Spartak that's gonna happen soon, it's gonna be kinda same. Damn, it's SKA-Khabarovsk now, sorry
– Aight, guess you gotta chill a bit. Good luck on the battle!
– Antihype!

– Salute! Introduce yourself
– My name is Miron
– Who's your opponent?
– My opponent is my old dickrider
– Why did you decide to accept to battle with him?
– Well, I didn't accept it, I invited him. He's a true battle MC, I never battled against those. They're people who can't really write songs, they're always battling, so they become sort of local gods, so I'm interested, just for the sport of it, to see how I'll perform against him
– You're a successful man, why do you need battles?
– I'm doing it just for the sport of it, as I said. I started with battles, I'm not stopping any time soon. Just to prove to myself, another check mark, another check mark. Or no check mark, I'm ready for whatever
– How does it feel to battle on behalf of Versus? Today is the battle between two battle leagues and we  came here to fuck those guys from Slovo up
– Yep
– How do you feel?
– I'm ready for this
– Well, good luck then

[Round 1: Oxxxymiron]
I'm here just for fun, really, just to mock a weak one
You crawled out of your mother while my Baban diss was playing in background
Accusatory pathos is zilch against the father
Those rhymes were written by drunk and high Kripl
You're funny, way too tall, and you're honestly clumsy
Your body reminds me of a pregnant heron
Unproportional, like your hype and your contribution into rap
Not A Cloud in Trousers, you're just a trend, like cloud rap
Here only for couple seasons. Where's your choker? Why?
You don't wanna go out of vogue, like Volchok clothes
The person who pushed you forward a year ago with just one tweet
Now will flush you away in the toilet
What an Irony of Fate, fascinating, isn't it?
Before battling someone, I have to praise him
To prove all of you that he can be the victor
Before crushing an MC, you have to love him in the beginning
I did great
I knew that Gotham needed a Joker
Who's against me. Full moon rising
The town cheers for him, a new character in the deck
But I'm the director myself, I created you, I filmed you
I'm Bruce Wayne and Christopher Nolan together
All roles are prepared already, yours is written from the beginning to the end
I needed an enemy? Voila!
You're a theatrical villain, your mustache fell off
Yeah, you're a Joker, but up my sleeve. Shave your ace
And get ready, Arkham gives you a free lodging
And my dick knows what's up with all these cuts you have
[Slava KPSS interrupts him]
I agree

I'm the master of promotion
You found the casting and started pulling off your underwear:
– Are you really the producer?
– Yes, I really am
I'll make you, son. You're my anal slave
Call me Fadeev Maxim
That's a fat promotion
I'm taking you off a cage by pulling the strings
How does it feel when you know that you're a marionette in the Jew's hands?
You hyped for a year using my name
Okay, I don't mind the hype
It's just sad that you're a miserable lackey
Couldn't go up yourself, still a nobody at the bottom
Your "fans" are angry that I don't release a new mixtape
Your eyes tell me that you wrote text for this battle back in December
Because the school of Slovo...

[Restorator screams]
IS THE WEAKEST LEAGUE IN THE COUNTRY

Yeah, we're about SlovoSPB. You got owned by RBL
I'd get bodied by Zabe, Teeraps, and Piem, if they tried
But the rest, all of you are mediocrities
30 weeks for the text, and then fake, pretend you just started writing
Been writing it in December, January, February, March, April
May, June, July. And thought, the text is ok, Tech N9ne, boo!
I wrote mine in a week, plus-minus two days
I'm afraid of you 30 times less than you're afraid of me
But don't be afraid. What do you have at stake, Olimpiyskiy?
Dozens of paid Petersburg people, who all depend on the battle
Who'll lose everything in case of a loss?
But an MC should be ashamed if he's been preparing for months
Memorized your lines? Good job!
[Slava KPSS replies]
Nope

The person frazzled by Ramzan

[Slava KPSS shouts]
Bodybag!

[Oxxxymiron repeats]
Bodybag!

When I invited him to battle, he was all about those ideals
But in a year you lost your way, Slava
What can a person, who repeated every mistake after me, in just one year, really tell me?
I'm nine years in this game, you're just helping me, slug
You, like myself, have changed? But the sales are still the same
You, like myself, have apologized? But no one even hit you!

Real talk, real talk

[Slava KPSS shouts]
Isn't it fucking wonderful, guys?

You, like myself, became a businessman, but still sound like a commissioner
You, like myself, were against that rap herd, but still recording with all of them
We're all hypocrites, because we change every day
What once was true, may change one day, perhaps even completely
But your worldview changed in a record time!
Bam! And you're on the stage
Bam! And you're recording with LSP
Bam! And you're releasing cheap clothes at Vitya SD's
The Flow is writing reviews, all good and real
But in a year underground cat became exactly what he had rebuked
And your idea, bled like Lyalya
You're throwing stones while sitting in a glass house
Was in the basement, but the attic got flooded
Searching for walls by running From Castle to Castle
But you build them on sand
And your showy kindergarten in your secondhand lyrics
Is obvious to everyone, believe me, it was boring to write a text against you
Even Johnyboy was more of a true guy, in comparison with you
Together, you should open a hookah-barber-sushi-smoothie-vape bar
Antihype? That's Vagabund, that's Vagabund
For people in backwoods who use Windows 3 with a dial up modem, while not knowing how to enable cookies
"We need more members", Booker taught you this way
You need to open an escort agency "Booking muzhchin"
And it's all giggles, but the truth hurts
He'll talk a lot, but he can't say much
You can dig up all the dirt and my dead friends
Can wash all my bones, along with dirty linen, cook your black kisel
Can find out with whom, how many times, and in what poses I had sex
But if you do this, you're done, too
Look, he has a girlfriend called Sasha Discotheque

[Slava KPSS interrupts him]
Not anymore, man, you're too late

[Oxxymiron replies]
It doesn't matter

Imagine how many punchlines about her I could come up with!
Or about ST's wife, it's so cute
But I came here to battle you, not her
Not your parents, not your mother's bank account
Not your promiscuous sexual behavior, Fallen doesn't count (here he is!) Fallen doesn't count

[Slava KPSS shouts]
Fallen! Fallen MC!

And he, who uses rumors about relatives, just shows who's the father on this arena
Think about it, lad, all you'll see is you getting promoted in MDK
How many millions I made last year – that's what Forbes and RBK are arguing about
Obviously, there's a bunch of rumors about me
I even stopped bringing groupies, what if they make a hole in a condom?
And then they will leak our photos to OK magazine, that's the dark side of being famous...
...just like his trip to Phuket half a year ago
Whoops!

[Slava KPSS puzzled]
What? Are you high? Are you high?

[Voice in background]
True story!

I have little birds too, and unlike yours they've got clip microphones on them
He thinks, "I hope he didn't find out about Golden Resort!"
Bro, there's no shame in it, there's no shame in it!
Let's put it this way. For a short time, and it was rather innocent
But he had a friend known as "the dancer"
Not really a masseur, not really a make-up artist, not really an exotic dancer
But that's not the problem, the problem was that he basically looked like a typical trans
Give me this folder!
Here. Now, I'd like anyone, who actually saw Karelin on Resort, to come here
Oh well, looks like there are none today, but a little bit more and y'all would believe me!
Battles with real facts! Battles with real facts!

[Voices in background]
Genius! Bravo! We need to think about this one

Battles with real facts – the gift for liars
The truth? Nah, just know how to present it properly

[Slava KPSS replies]
Yep

If you're gonna dig up all the dirt, searching in the garbage
You will represent not Slovo, but Podslushano Khabarovsk

[Slava KPSS cheers]
Yeeeaa. Nice!

So, basically, you have two lines of attack:
Either blame me for something you're even worse at, well, that's dumb
Or, like Cynics, be a dog, and come up with something rotten about me, shit yourself right here
Gnojnyj, your words are pure air
You look like E.T., but landed in Grozny, as it seems
It's easy to get in here swiftly, but as easy to get shredded
You had a decent year, it's not too late to leave
Time!

[Voices in background]
Slava, fuck him up! Slava, fuck him up!

[Round 1: Slava KPSS]
Slava KPSS and Oxxxy, the new punk wave
And everyone was waiting for a performance of the King and the Jester
Well, fuck this!
I declare, you're dead as a creator and you don't deserve to be honored as a cult rap singer
I don't accept your accomplishments, so when I spit my rhymes I remind you of your father
Let's talk about your album, analyze it in Lavrentiy Beria's cold-blooded manner
You performed poorly in your Gryffindor, if there's something Russians are good at, then it's destroying the empires
Everyone waited four years for it, he tried his best to intrigue them
And what he came up with? Recorded an audiobook
A trivial dystopia, by the way
That's the level of discourse of Jahmal and Loik
With a plot that any stupid whore could come up with
Your rap is cheap literature in paperback
It's just a bunch of the most boring cliches in history
Original plot: tragic love story in a dystopia
No one fucking came up with something like this before, right?
Neither Orwell nor Zamyatin
It's a pop motif everyone fucking fed up with already
But you said it yourself to Afisha, "It's not about how good an idea is, it's only about its survivability"
Well, if your music is a brand, then why don't I choose Gucci?
It's commercial too, just like your allegedly breakthrough album with the smart punchlines with a dash at the end
A used condom can make some noise too, if it ends up in a female monastery
I remember that fucking feeling when your fans started playing your album loudly in my house
It felt like I'm a honey dipper who got his annual salary paid in shit
Well, look at this little fuck who emerged as a king
Loved to drop names so much that he even came up with his own ones
So conceptual because you got tired of the craft
You ran out of ideas even before you started writing
Used to be "against everybody", now he's kinda our guy
The album is so crap that it got praised by Noize, you get it?

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Right in the heart! Right in the heart!

You said he was a graphomaniac to the core
And he praises Gorgorod, and not, let's say, your first mixtape
It's not a coincidence, Ogorod is a piece of grinded out shit
I don't see 11 tracks, I see 11 sentences for raping myself
You come up with new characters like a fucking cripple sculpts in clay with his stump hands
It's hard to mix up you and a poet, like a bag of dicks and a spinner
"A slim print of a shoulder", teachers, what a shame!
You couldn't see this in Pasternak's work, it's simply illiteracy!
A print of a slim shoulder! Fuck, writing isn't your strongest suit
You come up with not punchlines, but silliness like "handball world record"
The fuck is this? It's on your album
The fuck is this, idiot? Where's the work on the word?
Where are the unexpected meanings, man?
It sounds like a misstep in porno:
You thought if people lick your ass, you can shit on the tongue
And when you get a diarrhea, you know what will be the ugliest?
That all your trips into the toilet are connected with each other, even your shit is conceptual!
Fuck all the dumb politicians and all those greedy bankers
The worst are you, the creators of this indecent subjectivity
Where "third-tier remix of Yesenin" or top-tier one of Aldous Huxley
Have the social approval. But I don't fucking care about Jewish fairy tales
I don't listen to Gorgorod, don't read Torah, and don't hang around Echo of Moscow
Weird, they love the bald ones in the Right Sector, but they would still fuck you up

[Shouts to the crowd]
Hush! Hush!

For Brodsky-like graphomania, Yesenin-like shit-tier lyricism
Where are you walking the edge yourself? At the edge of a pool near a hotel?
Fuck, when you tell me that I'm not really a musician
And only live on some dubious hype
You'll basically describe yourself
After all, Gorgorod is not even a good calque, not a napalm, but a bubble gum
You just shit a bunch of liberal cliches
But writing dystopias, what kind of a protest is that, dumbo?
Useless like police shooting a gay parade with rubber bullets
You didn't spit from the barricades
And even your favorite Lamar said "fuck Trump!"
But for you "fuck up" is an open visors evening
Where you're afraid to talk freely. And even He Is Not Dimon to You
Is braver in this aspect than your fucking album
You're like, "I'm not a politician, I'm an artist, I don't write statements, I write tracks"

[Voice in background]
True story!

But like a politician you're a populist, otherwise why would you get into all this?
You were rooting so fucking much for Russia that you started nervously losing ganglia?
But when we had protests here, where you were? In England!
London, London, teach us how to live! How are we Rebuilding Russia without you?
You impose your dime novel as political satire
But don't call them by names, it's full of Jewish surnames
And we have a tradition in Russia, we don't call the names when we talk about a rat in our own collective
Meanwhile I bring you the revolution, like back in the days, straight from Tushino
The wheels of this cart are spinning. The Futurists threw Pushkin from the steamship of modernity!
And you kept Oxxxy. Because he's alive!
But he's just a living proof of how anyone can run out of ink and become a nobody in four years
Spent your talent, not on the hop, but on dope and dust
Your Oxxxy is just an inflated figure, like a glass rooster
Time!


[Round 2: Oxxxymiron]
Yo. He said he didn't listen to Gorgorod, but the spring will tell us who shit where
The whole your first round is a paraphrase of the track "Who You Became". Think about it

[Slava KPSS and Oxxxy]
– Nope. Nope, it's not
– Yes, it is. Relisten it again, bro
– Nope. I did listen to it

Anyway. Yo. Give me mic, start the cypher, let's hype
Let's offend mother and lie, steal and bite
Pour a tub of shit over the brothers, ghostwriter is found
Rhythm? Fuck it! On the battle, become more popular than aristocracy
So, stop it. Don't compare us
Back in the day I was anti-, was breaking their moral grounds
So I could shit on an average man – pioneer
I should have kept you as sperm on the bed
Since what was fresh back then, back in the years
Completely different now, unfortunately, unfunny stand-up
One thing is violating a tabu, turn the crowd inside out
Twist the listener with the power of words, eat their soul
And another thing is a conveyor of shit
No goals, only one idea: to get the most likes. Isn't it true
That like Ernesto you wanted to get on TV?
It's okay, I don't judge. Even though your duplicity is kinda awful
Actually, whatever, he's a swindler
Personally, I never performed on a corporate party
It's hard to hear for me when people are chewing
Never was on radio, was on TV only once
Even though I get a lot of requests daily, like it's PMs from lolis
Meanwhile, if you were me, you'd be singing in Golden Ogonyok right now
Saying "I'm here just to troll"
True, true story

[Slava KPSS replies]
Yes

To give you an idea, I didn't record with Major Lazer for 15 millions
You'd suck a black cock for pocket change from a sponsor, like the writer Limonov

[Slava KPSS pointing at Oxxxy]
Smart guy

And they say, "Mirosha, you crazy!"
Nope, I just don't like Major Lazer
They say, "you're a dumbass"
But true fans know, I appreciate them, Oxxxytentacion
I have three X's too, ayy
You'll disappear, like my mixtape
A lot of doubts, Miron, ayy
Who likes penises in his mouth? Gay
You've got a new release? Ayy
You've got a hundredth release? Ayy
If your rap is rap, then my rap if you're with me shout "ayy!"
Look, only SlovoSPB remained silent. WindbagsSPB
I will never visit you, like it's a school of MVD
Underdogs of battle rap? Nah, you're snobs without cash
Topical battle with Shurygina? It's the bottom of SPB

[Slava KPSS asking]
What does it have to do with me?

Nah, I'm not even arguing, Versus is bullshit too
With such an energetic start, it became a nightmare in half a year

[Oxxxymiron to Restorator]
You thought I'd give you a line and will remain silent?
Yeah, we're friends, but you shit on what we started together

[Slava KPSS talking to his friends in background]
Easy. Like I said, he talks about this shit

And that's not a stab in the back, Sanya, remember with Jan
How many times did I explain it to you?
Versus used to be a place where we'd find the new talents
Now it's a place where every mediocrity can get some quick dough
Where you can fall flat on your face, like Larin
A flock of blogger-fans will like these 5 minutes of fame anyway
Offbeat? Screw it! Reloads, reposts, BMW, BPM
Less rappers than sponsors. Circus!
What about rap-hagakure, the way of bushido?
I keep mumbling about the culture, like Redo bit me
"The old man is just envious of Khovan's and Eldar's success!", nah
It's just that all your idols have the same ghostwriter from Fresh Blood
And it's not a protest, I'm not hip-hop policeman
And when he doesn't offend the dead, Khovan is a pretty good guy
But since all of your bloggers and comics are passing through battle rap
Let's be honest and list all the writers

Easy, easy, real talk, real talk

But I believe, Versus will resurrect
And if it's not Slovo, then it's a bluff
Me and Sanya have a bunch of fuck ups
But wounded lion is still a lion
While a healthy jackal remains a jackal
You thought I'm afraid of somebody?
Your jokes, punchlines, Zamay and Berserk?
Bro, I've seen much worse, I swear!
Console yourself that you're still underground
And you're still on top
But I'm like NTV, who wants all the ins and outs of SlovoSPB?
Well, listen what happened five years ago
There was no Versus, no Slovo, rap was shouting "dat's what's up!"
Andrey Mikheyev knew, that I'm following King of the Dot since 2008, and told that to Hyde
Krasnodar is on the line, we spoke through Skype for 3 hours
Hints, questions, how to write texts for battles
I remember how I explained them that I'm tired of freestyles
All the schemes, flips, who to stand correctly
And we both were sick with this shit
Well, that's basically the whole story, how this project was born
I was there in the beginning, kiss the ring! Dat's what's up!
Since I was the consigliere of Don Anton, your godfather
Everyone who says "what?" doesn't know the history
Anyway
So, don't want to kiss the ring?
How predictable, he's not an authority to you
You wanna organize your own battle-quartet

[Talks to Den Cheney]
But Cheney, stop this bullshit, you knew
I kept the neutrality, but you keep misleading everyone
You and Berserk didn't just leave Hyde
Betraying father and the project
You secretly registered your rights for the project!
And I heard this story

Real talk, real talk in this bitch

First you secretly registered your right for the project
And I heard this story from you and PLC
You came up with a bunch of excuses, but I asked you straight:
If Hyde and PLC are really exploiting the weak, fascists
And you're innocent victims, slaves of the franchise
Then why didn't you create a new battle with a new name, but stole their name and registered it like rats?
And you know what he told me? True story:
"Eastern Roman Empire", remember?
We were sitting in front of 1703, Koryushka party, remember, remember!
"Eastern Roman Empire didn't change their name when they separated from Roman"
Well, Deniska, you're a bad boy, a radish
When I was partying with him, I kept my wallet really close
And thanks for the history class you read me generously
Unfortunately, pathos and demagoguery won't help you, Denis
You abandoned the ship and stole a loose lifeboat in a hurry
Brought a crew of midgets, kept telling us bullshit for years
And you didn't visit us to be friends, you hated us
Your tamed nigga Stefan and a pocket Jew Edik
You're forever in the shadow of your Big Brother
You're a calque, even while drunk
You're Restorator on minimal settings
You're not Slovo, you're not Versus, you're a fake branch
Impostors, the whole logo is full of someone else's achievements
Die, SlovoSPB!
You built a crypt, thought you could hide it from them
Your story, but sorry, bro, I'm gonna open up this abscess
There's an alchemy formula, what's on top is on the bottom too
If rats are controlling Slovo, what do you expect from the servants?
And in you, like in a microcosm, Slovo truly reflects
All your envious intrusiveness, along with your stung pride
What's there left for Gnojnyj?
Keep trolling and be always against something
Except you, sir, when trolling, you don't fight, you echo me

[Talks to Zamay]
If it's cool, Zamay, alright, continue
Continue offending me in vain, bro

Bullshitting about hype with Antihype you can't hide the lack of meaning behind the predicate
And I dunno why Jubilee found the feigned couldn't-care-less attitude
Dunno why Ernesto battled you like a you're an angry communist
You're simply empty, absolutely empty, nothing behind your soul, I'm sorry for it
You were spitting rhymes about monkeys, but you're a primate too
But you're a primacy of the form over the content
Diss after diss, after release, after mixtape, after remix. Your incontinence is so huge
That you've got diarrhea without shit, it's simply water. Instead of your ass you use your two hemispheres
You're not a byaka, you're way too fragile
Achilles, turtle, heel
Soaking up, like a sponge
But I'm gonna squeeze you, like a rag
You're cheap copy of Versus
You are a funny cosplay of me
Waiting for the new intro, where Cheney riding a Lexus around 1702 bar
It's hard to forget me, impossible to hurt my feelings, all your tries are off the mark
Miss Russia, Oksana Fyodorova, Sonya is here as an ugly friend
I'm not a partymaker, I'm a bodybagger
Antifaker, original Russian hater
My mother is Jewish, my father is like Drake's father
Bitch, I'm Ice Kid like Grime Kid and fuckin' bagging
Canning, motherfucking, Town, E16, baby!
Slava, it's time to go to bed, collect the stickers
But no matter what you won't understand how to write cool tracks
Since the only thing you're good at is battling and creating remakes
And me? I'm the Universal Soldier, the clubs won't be sold out
While you *spits* keep removing my saliva from your forehead
You dolt, we're family here, Obi and Drago are both friends
We're like The Three Musketeers from Remarque's and Dumas' novel
How do you say it? *pow pow* In your face with RPG
Your praised legion? Plasterboard and particle board
Y'all are just loudmouths with teen overblown ego
Versus is something SlovoSPB can never be!
That's it, that's the whole story with chronicle
And my dead homie aka Nikolay Gumilyov will help me with the epilogue
That's about you:

In olden days, when above the new world
God inclined his face, then
The sun was halted with a word
A word could destroy cities

And the eagle would not flap its wings
The terrified stars would cling to the moon
When, like a pink flame
The word floated in the heavens

But you have forgotten the word alone
Is numinous among earthly struggles
And in the Gospel According to John
It is said that the word is God

You have chosen to limit it
To the boring limits of nature
And, like bees in a deserted hive
Dead words smell bad

Versus!

[Oxxxymiron talks while brooming]
– I don't mind
– Could clean the sneakers too, while you're at it
– Nah, bro

[Round 2: Slava KPSS]
So well-mannered, huh?

Thought you invited me to battle. That's a brave deed as for a Jew
And then I realized, that's not bravery, it's just a common sense:
If you're fighting, you die faster
You reanimated my career, hyped it up to eleven!
One day I'm gonna write a book called "The tweet that changed my life"
But my grandpa is Johnyboy and he taught me, "don't believe the Jew
Cuz if he's throwing you a ring buoy then your career is sinking"
So no remorse! KPSS is in this skirmish
The only sober like it's a drunk fight
Remember the communist from the forum tore you a new one?
I'm not Baban's biter, I'm mimicking the maniac
Are you really an opponent for me, though, with punchlines about "this big"?
Imma fuck you up with whatever I have lying around
Here's a shelf full of your fuck ups, I'm picking a random one
You considered Guf to be shit, now you kinda admire him
"The burry talent", huh?
You'd be like "fuck it" towards the Russian rap, but it's a hard thing to do when you're castrated
Either you're a trimmer or it took you years to see Guf's talent, go figure
You represent this cheap shit called the Plastic World
And if the judges look at him lovingly then consider him a winner already
Knowing where the noise is coming from is your superhero ability
Oxxxy vane, he changes his direction even when someone is blowing a tailwind
Yeah, this soldier doesn't hold a defense
Fuck, even a pathologist gets under the skin more frequently than him
Can't say a bad word about anyone nowadays
According to the contract, you remain toothless, like Alexander Ovechkin
We're on the war here, yeah
And you ran away, leaving behind the outpost
You just stand aside and watch
Like those Germans who allowed the Holocaust
You say you changed the direction?
Nah, you only changed where you're rowing towards
Stopped fucking others' mothers, he's an adult now, what's next?
A battle every year, so what, where are the punchlines?
Your bars in battles are an ugly bride
Wanna marry her off, but she got nothing to ask the price for
And how a person can stand behind something if there's nothing to stand behind?
It's painful to watch your attempts
You get the battle contexts just as good as the dude in "Dad reacts to Versus" videos
Check it fucking yourself, fantastic Miron's punchlines without himself lose their shine
"You're not the creator of golems, but on this photo you're like a potter"!

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Top punchline!

And that's not the only one. The one about fucking "awl in the ass", "the bad energetics" one, "Gulkin's dick" one
If someone else used those, they'd send him to RBL

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
– RBL respect!
– Fuck them

But not you, nah, since you came up with this obscene counting-out rhyme
What's next? On this battle you gonna fart in front of a lighter?
Or the one about pithecanthropus, bro
That punchline was really fucking dumb
I'm not Oxxxymiron, but
You guys perform like a lubricant on a dickhead
Exactly the same, absolutely no additional information
On his next album he's gonna rhyme, "We give you everything, like a passport in UVD!"
Or about fucking clitoris geolocation
Clitoris geolocation, wonderful!
So you don't believe in ZOG, but believe that a clitoris sends some information to a satellite?

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
It was a joke, idiot

And his texts are full of shit like this
Works perfectly ofc, since he serves it with an arrogant face of an expert
"My flow is a DDoS attack, we've got the remote access"!

[Oxxxymiron replies]
So-so punchline, yeah

Remote access, eh?
You shitty scholar, we won't get far in space with specialists like this
DDoS actually prevents the remote access!

[Oxxxymiron talks to his friend in the crowd]
Jan, I checked this punchline with you, why didn't you tell me?

Or maybe "you're speaking too fast, and I'm listening too slow"?
They even made merch based on this phrase, for the smartest ones
But what you might not know is that this phrase was first used in 2010 by Nonna Grishayeva in the TV show Big Difference

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Dunno who that is, sorry bro

Yeah? So either you stole it knowingly
Or your level, scum, is comedy cud from TV
So those who get it and who can't stand the TV
Won't notice the difference if "City under the sole" is playing there the whole day
But Miron doesn't need punchlines, he's an interesting dude either way
Today you're watching battles without punchlines, and tomorrow it's gonna be porn without girls

[Oxxxymiron talks to his friends behind]
My texts don't have any punchlines? I don't get it

Personalities, personalities, personalities!
What are those fucking personalities?
They believe that I was drinking piss from a boot, and that you dated Sonya Grese

[Oxxxymiron shouts]
Never!

And that your mouth has so much protein in it that you can bake the full tray of meringue
Since battles are the after-truth territory
It doesn't matter which fact is truthful
So what's up with the personalities, fucking retard, it's all about the number of punchlines
I've got a full pack of equivalent bars, like it's Fix Price
If the king dies, the coffin should be king-size
Oh, you need a cupboard to keep the skeletons of those you've battled with?
I've got an interesting fact for you: I need 4 of those, since I've battled 16 times
And they put you against the wall with John
I guess out of this firing squad I'm the only one who has live ammunition?
They buried themselves, but you pretended like you're helping them:
You motivated ST, threw a ring buoy to John, was lecturing Kripl

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
You're next, you're next, you're next. Let's do this, let's do this, let's do this

[Slava KPSS shouts at the audience]
Silence! Shut the fuck up, bitches!

Listen here, you fucking piece of crap, you can seduce others with your sonnets
I'm not Finland for you, so don't you, bitch, come to me with your pieces of advice
And stop talking about yourself. Fuck, I call you Dryomin
A battler is supposed to be a psychologist, and not act like he's visiting one

[Oxxxymiron addresses the viewer]
Hah! Remember this

If you forget about the opponent while battling him
Then you're probably jerking off near the toilet when you visit your girlfriend
And the she says, "Miron, let's move to my place?"
And you reply, "I don't wanna fuck with you, I'm here to improve my results from the previous sex!"
The father of battle rap in Russian, you produce some dubious stuff
Antihype is a social service, I take the parental rights away from you
You act like you're fighting for improvement, but it's all empty talk
You have never visited another battle league
How would you know if the culture is still alive if you don't measure the pulse?
Make battle rap great again? You don't even know that it's dying, no new talented MCs
Raytraun is battling at Versus now. We're doing the remakes of the old finals
In fact, we're kicking around the dead genre
Battle rap is dead, there's no underground
Meanwhile, mainstream is a shame, like Fresh Blood on blood
But if it's gonna die while being filmed
I wanna be the gun shooting at Brandon Lee!

Oh, and I wanna pronounce the time of death: 17:03!
Time!

[Round 3: Oxxxymiron]
Have you noticed this? Third rounds always hit the hardest
MCs always put some intrigue into them
But I'm a nerd, so I'm gonna sacrifice it, screw it!
I wanna talk about books

[Talks to Slava KPSS]
– You can take a nap in meanwhile
– Gonna humiliate me now, for Jacques Genet?
– Nah, nah, nah

There's this great book called The Hero with a Thousand Faces
I bet it's gonna sell well now
I read it back in Kiev this crazy spring
When I was deep in the solitude
The tongue left me, I was stuck
You don't know what it is
Everyone was wondering: drinking or preparing a new release?
Meanwhile I was there, just sitting on a balcony
(Those rhymes are so-so, right?
But whatever, they're true.)
That book returned me back to life
I realized that I'm still alive
And the same book inspired Lucas, back in the day, to write (Where's Obi? Oh, there he is) Star Wars
The idea is simple: in all mythologies, in all religions, no matter how many
And in the base of any story there's on motif:
Someone hears the voice from afar
He leaves the home alone
He takes the road out of the town
Goes straight into a forest full of nets
Finds some monsters on his way
He fights them, still alone
He's not a hero yet, he's afraid of everything
But he keeps going
Eventually, he finds the lair
It will be hard, but he'll make it
He'll kill the dragon, get back to home
But he won't be the same person he left
He'll sleep a bit, no doubt
And then will go out again
All the comic books are based on this
The TV shows, the layers of culture
The drug trips, the dystopias, the fairy tales, the fables, the sculptures, and the dreams
To the point that if you compare Egypt myths and Banditskiy Peterburg
You'll the the path of one hero under the disguise of these two
The path of the hero, killing the monsters
Collecting the treasures, building pagan temples
He's not a hero because he's ripped and he's a warrior
But because it can't be any other way
I remember the first battles in Russia
People thought you had to throw thousands dicks at the opponent
Then they started the deconstruction
Everyone would take the enemy apart
But behind all this kitchen psychology
Lies the collective unconscious

[Slava KPSS replies]
Oh yeah?

And behind any, even everyday one
Demonstration of negativity between two different people
You can see the ancient motif, collision of archetypes
The heroes, the dragons, they're still here
Even if the battle is in office between a stapler and a hole puncher
And the heroes are similar to the dragons, people mix them up, but wait
There's a fundamental difference between two
The dragon doesn't have his own way, doesn't have his own idea, no ideology
His role is to be an enemy. He's chilling in his lair, breathing the smoke with fire
Why doesn't, for example, Joker have his own movie?
Batman has one, Catwoman, Batman and Robin, but not him
Why is there no game where you're playing as a mushroom, jumping on Super Mario?
And if there was one, it would be a joke. Millions wouldn't be playing it
You get it. My analysis is rather simple
Gnojnyj, you're just one more level, but not the final boss
The hero isn't afraid to say I have the flaws, I'm vulnerable
That's why people will see themselves in him
They won't see anything in you
You're a snake, you're afraid of me and yourself
The only chance you have is to joke away, while mocking
You're a slippery bastard, can't catch you
Except it's not a feature, it's a bug, man
(Speaking of a programmer)
Because sarcasm is a shell, an armor, scales
But where are you, tovarisch?
I spit with the open visor, friends
Therefore you will lose
Maybe it's just the way it goes or the karma is just shitty
But you only played the antagonist's role
And that's the tragedy of Slava Mashnov, Karelin, et cetera
You are not an anti-hero, you are not a hero even
Zero empathy towards you
And crowd won't go after you
For them, you're just another person to follow in Instagram
You have no path, you used mine
But forgot that mine was sincere
Battle rap, black humor, and grime: where's Gnojnyj behind mockery and anonymity?
There's none, or he disappeared
You copied everything, even my gesture
Mister postmodernist, you are a compost, but shit-ist
All there's left for you is to be an MC on parties
(Fuck that, you don't have to make noise for that)
Oh, and maybe someone has noticed it
But my rounds have no mat in them
"How's that?", will ask me Gotham. "You're the author of that one quote."
It's simple: I'm battling against a shell-shocked, really bland rat
While obscene language is the crowning jewel of the great Russian language
Okay?
And let's say that today, perhaps, you will even defeat me

[Slava KPSS replies]
I will

I will get back to touring
You will get back to trolling me

[Slava KPSS replies]
Yep. That's fantastic!
Let's applaud the poet!

One hour caliphs, leaders for a moment
Look, ready to conquer the Olympus, while bragging about it
What?
My cake with candles is lit afar
I'm so old that "Black Star" for me is Talib Kweli and Mos Def

[Slava KPSS shouts]
Yeaaah, that's good stuff

And some voice is whispering:
"Drop this rap shit
Keep your trail clean
Before you end up degrading like brostep"
But the bunch of faces are blinded by the opposite light
Screeching, tears, underwear, we are a boy band
And you? You're momma's armchair critic
Listen, EeOneGuy
As Stalin once said:
"If you're criticizing something, then suggest something else!"
You gonna act like a fool, act recklessly
Doesn't matter, you're still in my rap coordinate system
If, one day, you come up with a different style
Because it's shameful to live by someone else's paradigm when you're 27
Then you will be on your own way, you'll be the protagonist of the narrative
Until then, you're what an ass came up with
Slava, Slava, you're jaunty and sweet
But take my organ out of your throat
You were a rather tall punching bag
I used to prepare myself for the battle with Dizaster!
Time!

[Voice from the crowd]
Slava, you're just a marionette!

[Round 3: Slava KPSS]
You're so fucking narcissistic, bro. "I'm grime!"
But if you google "grime", you'll see my video from Slovo
That's how you promote grime those four long years
You're angry at me, because I call my bullshit "grime"?
You're so dumb, you don't even get the joke, moron
I stole the dearest from you, like it's kidnapping
Because of me, grime in Russia is now rap battles with fast flow

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Is that your opinion?

Think I do this out of pity or because I wanna become famous?
I'm just laughing at you, you fucking bald female midget
And I'm okay with a status of Vkontakte-artist
While you don't get it, like a postmodernist any money in a pawnbroker's shop
You migrated to Russia, but your hair are in panic
Ran away to Europe, like Syrian refugees
What's next on the menu? Let's talk about your Aryan schnoz
If it decides to leave, you know, like in Gogol's story
It will go straight to Israel, to get the dough
Since your nostril looks like the cave Christ was born in
Fuck, only you can refrain from battling for a year
Tatu dedicated their "Malchik Gay" to you
I need The Easy Way to Stop Battling, since I fuck a bunch of battlers like you every day
There's a red dwarf in front of me, like I see Betelgeuse in the telescope
Hail you down with a bunch of punchlines, call it flow Mayweather
Bodybag, since I play battle rap frequently
My number of frags is off the charts, like I'm playing laser tag
Fuck everybody!
Keep talking about nihilism, but you can tell a denier since he's shining from the inside out
"Fuck mainstream!"... shouted this counterculturist during his battle against Dunya
Now, using myself as an example, he explained why this way leads nowhere
"It's miserable and awful, but why do I need this boiling shit?
I declined even Evening Urgant's offer!"
Declined, yeah? You're a Jew, remember?
Here you're so true, but behind the curtain...
You declined the commercial offers to get all the fattest ones!

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Real talk, real talk
What about you, though?

He went to Urgant, after all, but was outrageously... neat there
Wore a shirt with a dumb print
Damn, you showed them corporate pigs!
Take that, fucking cultural terror! Weren't ready?
If they invite him to Dom-2, he'll wear socks with sandals
Fuck off with your Showroom, stick your stock market data up your ass
I roll you into a shawarma and shove it in Khovan's throat!
Enough!
You meshed so well with the image of the saint buffoon, you'll feel a mild pain when I start tearing it off, along with the flesh
"My work with Reebok is to create something new and not grab the cash from the fans"
They take some old sneakers, put the Oxxxy logo on them, and then double the price!
Fuck, that's what you were fighting for?
Well, you're out of luck
You were a hungry MC, ate others, and became spoiled
It's really pitiful
To see a lonely and sad 30-years old man who drags a fangirl into his dressing room
Fuck it, I dedicate this to all the girls:

You like the Mayor's song so much
Don't know about postmodern rap
You go wild when you hear "Devochka-Pizdets" and go on Oxxxy's concert
But remember: even the prince can be a scumbag
And if he sees a princess in you, he's like a dragon
Can catch you and fuck you in the cave!
Yeah, in your very own little cave
So what about the battle with Schokk?
"He was like a brother to me, I'll never make a show out of it!"
Well, that's honorable, to not shit on those you were together with
But then you quarrelled with LSP and acted like Buzova at Lobnoe mesto
You released an hour-long video to throw shit at your former artist
Therefore that's exactly what your current artists can expect to happen later
Makes sense, right?
And at the end he said, "If we have to, we can solve this the other ways. It's not 2013, we're different now!"
Really? Are you proud that you're so brutal now you can beat LSP up?
Maybe you'll fucking kick Dzharakhov in his face too?
Or will leak a sex tape to fans?
God, no trans is trying so fucking hard to look masculine
Pretending to be a cowboy? Stop this shit
Only in Brokeback Mountain you could be the Red-ass Chief
You're spitting rhymes, you aren't robbing a bank
If you see a bunch of rods around you, then you're walking in a park
You forgot what the hatred is
In a beef, you're like a disabled person in a wheelchair
"The scum assumed my kindness was a weakness". Fuck, that sounds like it's from the Twitter of some whore from the block!
Called Sasha a toastmaster, meanwhile you performed your verse from the battle on Serebro's corporate party
A toastmaster!
True story!

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
That was not a corporate party. I can prove it easily

More contests await! Turn off the lights
Whoever loses goes to Butyrka prison? Sure
After that situation with Chechnya, I'm the best at throwing a pencil into a bottle!
And you still live off that pretentious culture creator's shit, huh?
No self-irony, no mockery
"Porchy, Akela has missed!", when you're pissing past urinal
You narcissistic moron, that's not theatrical stage for you
But you spent more time in front of The Mirror than Andrei Tarkovsky
All those songs that are only about yourself
How you, alone, with a bag of polonium, for 6 years straight
"Didn't try to appeal to those who despised you at first"?
Dubious shit
Act in Zhigan's film? That's a really eloquent symptom
Apparently it's the only person in the world who has both Down and Stockholm syndromes!
Like general Vlasov, you are a piece of shit and a traitor
When you received the news from Berlin, you changed your side
Threw your friend away faster than the gangster his shawarma
I wouldn't let you to have my back, like you're a drunken tattoo master

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
You were fifteen

And all for the stadiums and the loud crowds?
Olimpiyskiy will be a great coffin for an ego of your size
And when I think, "Stop! That can't be it! Oxxxymiron is way smarter than that"
I remember that you like Lyokha Med
That you praise Mozee Montana and dream about performing in Olimpiyskiy

[Oxxxymiron intervenes]
Yeah. Things, things

Fuck, you're as picky about your tastes as a young whore at a house party!
How angry he was when he couldn't sign Bumble Beezy
He chose... "Punchlines and Rhymes"
Your booking has a problem, Beezy is the Russian Lil Peep
But MCs aren't memes for you to steal them from "RiP"
Fuck, wanna earn money with booking? It's easier to earn money with Booker
Your shots are flat like it's a platformer shooter game
Rem Digga was rhyming about Donbass, people went into trenches after him
And the only person who did anything after you is Urgant, who drew a dick on his neck

[Slava KPSS shouts at the crowd cheering him]
Shush! Shush! Shush!

You didn't live near the verbal ore in a mine
But you're so fucking pretentious, like you were in the same school with Putin
"Only forward! Only the progress!"
But what kind of progress? Towards the Western sound?
Any newbie can make beats like yours nowadays
Towards quality? Well, we heard your tracks
You even admitted yourself they were mixed in a slapdash manner
So, what's up, stadium rapper? Where are you going?
You don't cut the window to the West, you're the Rat-catcher of Hamelin
You bring everyone to the bottom along with you
Like all of your new school. I've heard plenty of this stuff
If you wanna do like them, just be a McDonald's franchisee
If there is good kid, m.A.A.d city already, why the fuck do I need Gorgorod in my player?
Solving creativity challenges someone has already solved
Is like reusing a teabag
Yeah, you can do it, but it's not the same. Shameful stuff for poor rappers
Who lack any new ideas. You are not Kendrick Lamar in Russia
In your whole career there was nothing except for fucking self-reflection
"Me, me, me", all the stuff you recorded is about your own figure
You talk so fucking much about culture, but have you even tried giving it a careful thought?
No, you have not. Even in our shitty song about vape we've said way more
All your rap is about nothing, because it's about Oxxxy

So, fuck you and fuck Versus, with its submissive crowd!
I would rather die a fucking noname than become famous and end up being like you!

[Slava KPSS asks Oxxxymiron]
– Would you let me drink your water?
– Nah. I can give the whole bottle to you, though
– Thanks
– Won't drink from the same bottle as you
– WellEmbed

Like I Love You by Justin Timberlake

Just somethin' about you
Way I'm lookin' at you, whatever
Keep lookin' at me
Gettin' scared now, right?
Don't fail me, baby
It's just Justin
You feel good, right?
Listen

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I kinda noticed somethin' wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kinda weird to me since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song with me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Can't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

See, people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing? (Thing, thing)

When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember
Sing a song with me

[Verse 3: Pusha T, Malice, (Justin Timberlake)]
Ma, whatchu wanna do? I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see? I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
In the mall, kids ask, "How'd the chain glow?"
Point to her, they say, "Wow, it's the same glow"
Point to me, I say, "Yeah, it's the same dough"
We the same type, you my a-like (Yeah)
You have me sleepin' in the same bed every night
Go ride with me, you deservin' the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called "Brain" (I just love your, brain)
Ma, took a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake, now how heavy is that?

You will know the difference when I—
Break it down

You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, drums (Hey)
It's kind of special, right? Yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes, people just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now, everybody dance12Embed

My heartbeat's racin'
Tempt me (Tempt me), try me (Try me)
Feels so exciting
Thought of highly
It's yours entirely

More than a woman, more than your other

More than a woman, more than enough for you

Midnight grindin'
Heart rate's climbin'
You go (You go), I go
Cause we share (We share) pillows (Pillows)
Chase me, leave me

No Such Thing by John Mayer

29 ContributorsNo Such Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
"Welcome to the real world", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

[Pre-Chorus]
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
[Chorus]
I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

[Verse 2]
So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats, grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers
They read all the books, but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories, tiny tragedies

I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

[Bridge]
I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive

[Chorus]
I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion
I'm going to bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for16Embed

Let me be your hero

[Verse 1]
Would you dance, if I asked you to dance?
Would you run, and never look back?
Would you cry, if you saw me crying?
Would you save my soul, tonight?
Would you tremble, if I touched your lips?
Would you laugh? Oh please, tell me this
Now would you die, for the one you loved?
Hold me in your arms, tonight

[Chorus]
I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

Or would you lie?
Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?

A New Day Has Come - Radio Remix by Céline Dion

11 ContributorsA New Day Has Come (Radio Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
A new day (Ah-ah)
A new day (Ah-ah)

[Verse 1]
I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on, and don't shed a tear
Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love

[Chorus]
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come
(Oh, oh, oh)

I wanted to be like you
I wanted everything
So I tried to be like you
And I got swept away
I didn't know that it was so cold
And you needed someone to show you the way
So I took your hand and we figured out that
When the tide comes, I'd take you away

[Chorus]
If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares

(Rollout) I got my twin Glock .40's (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that

[Verse 1]
Now, where'd you get that platinum chain with them diamonds in it?
Where'd you get that matchin' Benz with them windows tinted?
Who them girls you be with when you be ridin' through?
Man, I ain't got nothin' to prove, I paid my dues, breakin' the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin' a cruise
Tell me who's your weed man, and how do you smoke so good?
You's a superstar, boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that bag? What you got in that bag?
A couple of cans of whoop ass, you did a good-ass job of just eyein' me, spyin' me

Man, that car don't come out until next year, where in the fuck did you get it?
That's eighty thousand bucks gone, where in the fuck did you spend it?
You must have eyes on your back 'cause you got money to the ceilin'
And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin', the better I'm feelin', the more that I'm chillin', winnin', drillin' and killin' the feelin'
Now, who's that bucked naked cook fixin' three course meals?
Gettin' goosebumps when her body taps the six inch heels
What in the world is in that room, what you got in that room?
A couple of gats, a couple of knives, a couple of rats, a couple of wives, now it's time to choose

Are you custom made, custom paid, or you just custom fitted?
PlayStation 2 up in the ride, is that Lorenzo-kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin' the hips, touchin' lips to the top of the dick and then, "Whew"
Now, tell me who's your housekeeper, and what you keep in your house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?
What in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate, wait to take place at a similar pace, so shake, shake it

Never thought that we would ever be more than friends

We both thought it was cool to cross the line
And I was convinced it would be alright
Now things are strange, nothing's the same
And really I just want my friend back

And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Holdin' on)

And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Yeah)

I'd hate to walk away from you as if this never existed
'Cause when we kissed, the moment after, I looked at you different, yeah

I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman by Britney Spears

30 ContributorsI’m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman Lyrics[Verse 1]
I used to think I had the answers to everything
But now I know
That life doesn't always go my way, yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realized

[Chorus]
I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl

[Verse 2]
There is no need to protect me
It's time that I learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes

[Chorus]
I'm not a girl (Not a girl, not yet a woman)
Not yet a woman
(I'm just trying to find the woman in me)
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl

Tainted Love by Marilyn Manson

24 ContributorsTainted Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I feel I've got to run away
I've got to get away
From the pain you drive in the heart of me
The love we share seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night

[Chorus]
Once, I ran to you, now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I'll give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all

[Post-Chorus]
Tainted love (Oh-oh-oh)
Tainted love

[Verse 2]
Now, I know I've got to run away
I've got to get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
Need someone to hold you tight
And you'll think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way

Touch me baby, tainted love

Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love

I don't want to see you waiting
I've already gone too far away
I still can't keep the day from ending
No more messed-up reasons for me to stay

[Chorus]
Well this is not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time

You can't stop the feeling, there is no reason
Just make the call and take it all again
Whoa-oh, again

Months went by with us pretending
When did our light turn from green to red?
I took a chance and left you standing
Lost the will to do this once again

Ever seen a blind man cross the road
Trying to make the other side?
Ever seen a young girl growing old
Trying to make herself a bride?

And all I thought I had to do was smile
Well, you are still a young girl
And you've bought everything in style

22 ContributorsHands Clean Lyrics[Verse 1]
If it weren't for your maturity, none of this would've happened
If you weren't so wise beyond your years, I would've been able to control myself
If it weren't for my attention, you wouldn't have been successful, and if
If it weren't for me, you would never have amounted to very much

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this could be messy
But, but you don't seem to mind, and
Ooh, don't go telling everybody, and
And overlook this supposed crime

[Chorus]
We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

[Verse 2]
You're essentially an employee and I like you having to depend on me
You're a kind of protégé, and one day, you'll say you learned all you know from me, and
And I know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
I know you sexualize me like a young thing would, and I think I like ya

What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?

We best keep this to ourselves and not tell any members of our inner posse

I might wanna marry you one day, if you watch that weight and keep your firm body

I got this jones forming in my bones (From a man)
Who indeed took over my soul (Understand)
I couldn't breathe if he ever said (He would leave)
Get on my knees 'til they bloody red (Baby, please)
See, I don't know if you get it yet (Just don't know)

See, I could never feel alone with you (In my life)
I'll give up everything I own for you (Won't think twice)
Almost a shame how I'm mesmerized (Such a shame)
I lose my thought looking in your eyes (I know why)
Because your kisses make my lips quiver (And that's real)
And when you touch me, my whole body shivers (I can feel)

And when we speakin in tongues
Breathing hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you tryin to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up, but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill' and I'mma quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out
Just me and you, high off sex and twisted

'Cause if you were my girlfriend
I'd be your shining star
The one to show you where you are
Girl, you should be my girlfriend

[Verse 2: JC, Justin]
Does he know what you feel
(Does he know what you feel?)
Are you sure that it's real? (are you sure?)
Yeah, yeah
Does he ease your mind (nah)
Or does he break your stride? (c'mon)
Did you know that love could be a shield...? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: All, JC]
In the middle of the night (oh...)
Is he gonna be by your side? (no, no)
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know 'cause things ain't clear
And baby, when you cry (oh oh)
Is he gonna stand by your side? (no, no)
Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea, oh
[Chorus: All, Justin, JC]
So why don't you be my girlfriend? (yeah, yeah)
I'll treat you good (I'll treat you good, girl)
I know you hear your friends when they say you should
Baby, 'cause if you were my girlfriend
I'd be your shining star
The one to show you where you are
Girl, you should be my girlfriend

And everything says you were meant to be (meant to be...)
My girlfriend, oh

Drift through a summer breeze
It's a groovy night, and I can show you how to use it
Come along with me and put your mind at ease
Hey

A Woman's Worth by Alicia Keys

18 ContributorsA Woman’s Worth Lyrics[Verse 1]
You could buy me diamonds, you could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
(Baby, you know I'm worth it)
Dinner lit by candles, run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last and last
(Baby, you know I'm worth it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna please, wanna keep, wanna treat your woman right
Not just dough, but to show that you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth
Mm-mmm

[Chorus]
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her (Please her)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (First)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth (A woman's worth)

[Post-Chorus]

('Cause baby, I know you're worth it)

[Pre-Chorus]
She walks the mile, makes you smile, all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth

Strapped with the baby tec baby tec B.T

Ordered six shots and them things ain't around yet
Persona all thugged out loud and clear
Sayin fuck the straight Henny, just grab me a beer
You see I'm reppin now, and my mami's I got a weapon now
Shoot at them clowns at they feet, they high steppin now
Left that wack label cause I don't like pricks

At the white boy club while I'm buyin the bar

"Okay, here we go..."
Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song, and I want y'all to sing along
Sing along
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny day
When it's rainin' inside and you're all alone
All alone, yeah!
[Hook]
'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news

And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Take a little trip, hater, pack up your mind
Look forward, not behind, then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought he could rhyme
Now if his momma is a quarter, daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-
-ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See ain't nothing changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall; crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin' at the airport who got laid off
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole-whole world-world...

Player, I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat running like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stones, gather no moss
Mommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah, then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac OutKast, just won't stop

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music, we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing, God-willing, all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself, Dre
Set it on the right and I'll set it on the left, 'cause

This is for my number one
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
'Cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don’t feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you’re hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, "You make me sick"
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that’s hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'Cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self-destruct

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
'Cause I been imaginin' more ways
I’m gon' luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I’m gon' luv U better

And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin’ all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL’s, baguettes and rings
Instead I walk around like I’m a king
And having you ain’t nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin’ you the lovin’ was good
Too busy frontin’ in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don’t ever let go
I’ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don’t say no
'Cause I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it’s time for the pain to go, ya’know

A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin’ you foul names
Actin’ like females is all the same
I’m gon’ love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I’ll never be the same
I’ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you’re back in my life
But this time I’ma do it right

If You're Not The One by Daniel Bedingfield

21 ContributorsIf You’re Not the One Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you're not the one, then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one, then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine, then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine, would I have the strength to stand at all?

[Pre-Chorus]
I never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

[Chorus]
I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?

[Verse 2]
If I don't need you, then why am I cryin' on my bed?
If I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me, then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me, then why do I dream of you as my wife?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I'm praying you're the one I build my home with
I hope I love you all my life

Body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you
Into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
'Cause I love you
Whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
You know my heart is by your side

I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand

7 ContributorsCaught in the Middle Lyrics[Verse 1: Paul]
You said that love was just a state of mind
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find
And for me you never really had the time, and
I was blind

[Verse 2: Christian]
And everything that you meant to me
Is written in the pages of my history
But it's over now as far as I can see
Suddenly

[Chorus: Ben, All]
Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy, I was wrong
(And now I'm caught)
And now, I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think about is you
(And now I'm caught)
And now, I'm caught in the middle
