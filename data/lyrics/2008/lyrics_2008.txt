3 ContributorsHot Rap Songs Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs LyricsTo honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential "Yo! MTV Raps" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.

If I Were a Boy by Beyoncé

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home

Show me how to lie, you're getting better all the time
And turning all against the one is an art that's hard to teach
Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd
And as you step back into line, a mob jumps to their feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Now dance, fucker, dance, man, he never had a chance
And no one even knew it was really only you
And now you steal away, take him out today
Nice work you did, you're gonna go far, kid

With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives

[Verse 2]
Slowly out of line, and drifting closer in your sight
So play it out, I'm wide-awake, it's a scene about me
There's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay
And if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now dance, fucker, dance, man, I never had a chance

American Boy by Estelle, Kanye West

2 ContributorsAmerican Boy LyricsKanye West:
Just another one champion sound
Me and Estelle about to get down (get down)
Who the hottest in the world right now?
Just touched down in London town

Bet they give me a pound
Tell them "Put the money in my hand right now." (Yes!)
Tell the promoter "We need more seats."
We just sold out all the floor seats

Estelle:
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see L.A
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy

He said "Hey sister
It's really, really nice to meet ya."
I just met this 5 foot 7 guy who's just my type
I like the way he's speaking
His confidence is peaking

Don't like his baggy jeans but I'mma like what's underneath them
And no I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York heart awaits
First let's see the west end. I'll show you to my brethren
I'm likin' this American boy. American boy

Can we get away this weekend?
Take me to broadway
Let's go shopping maybe then we'll go to a café
Let's go on the subway

Take me to your hood
I neva' been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good
Dressed in all your fancy clothes
Sneakers looking fresh to death I'm lovin' those shell-toes

Walkin' that walk
Talk that slick talk
I'm likin' this American boy. American boy

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see L.A
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy

Tell 'em wagwan blud
Kanye West:
Who killin' 'em in the UK?
Everybody gonna to say you K, reluctantly
Cause most of this press don't fuck wit me
Estelle once said to me

"Cool down down don't act a fool now now."
I always act a fool oww oww
Ain't nothing new now now

He crazy, I know what ya thinkin'
Ribena I know what you're drinkin'
Rap singer. Chain blinger

Holla at the next chick soon as you're blinkin'
What's your persona bout this Americana? Rhymer
Am I shallow cuz' all my clothes designer?

Dressed smart like a London bloke
Before he speak his suit bespoke
And you thought he was cute before
Look at this peacoat, tell me he's broke

And I know you ain't into all that
I heard your lyrics I feel your spirit
But I still talk that ca-a-ash
Cause a lot wags want to hear it
And I'm feelin' like Mike at his baddest
Like the pips at they gladdest
And I know they love it
So to hell with all that rubbish

Estelle:
Would you be my love, my love?
Could you be mine would you be my love my love, could you be mine?
Could you be my love, my love?
Would you be my American boy? American boy

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to Chicago, San Francisco Bay
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy. American boyEmbed

Five, four, three, two, one, ah!

You were a child crawlin' on your knees toward it
Makin' Mama so proud, but your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughin'
You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences

A family of trees wanted to be haunted

The water is warm, but it's sendin' me shivers
A baby is born, cryin' out for attention
The memories fade like lookin' through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby

Good Life by Kanye West, T-Pain

3 ContributorsHot Rap Songs Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs LyricsTo honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential "Yo! MTV Raps" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.

And I feel awkward as I should
This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

[Verse 2]
I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me

I did my best to notice
When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought, but I was kind
And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes, clear your heart

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cut the cord

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

[Verse 2]
Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well

Ain't No Rest for the Wicked by Cage The Elephant

59 ContributorsAin’t No Rest for the Wicked Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said, "I never seen a man, who looks so all alone
Oh, could you use a little company?
If you pay the right price, your evening will be nice
And you can go and send me on my way."
I said, "You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?"
She looked at me and this is what she said:

[Chorus]
"Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good"

[Verse 2]
Not even fifteen minutes later I'm still walking down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight
And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
He said, "Give me all you've got, I want your money, not your life
But if you try to make a move, I won't think twice"
I told him, "You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask
What made you want to live this kind of life?"

He said, "There ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees

Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good"

[Verse 3]
Well now a couple hours passed and I was sitting in my house
The day was winding down and coming to an end
And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend
I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same
Oh yes, we all seek out to satisfy those thrills
[Chorus]
You know there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
We got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no we can't slow down, we can't hold back
Though you know we wish we could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good70Embed

I know you got that fever for me: hundred and two
And boy, I know I feel the same
My temperature's through the roof

If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me when I do, I do
If there's a camera up in here
Then I'd best not catch this flick on YouTube, YouTube
'Cause if you run your mouth
And brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, 'tween you and I

[Chorus]
Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

[Verse 1]
Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

[Verse 2]
Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

And think man I'd love to see that girl again

I know you're scared, baby, they don't know what we doing
Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up, girl, and I swear
I'ma give it to you non-stop
And I don't care who's watching
Watching, watching
In this club, on the floor
Baby, let's make love
[Chorus: Usher]
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)18Embed

Skinny Love by Bon Iver

104 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschSkinny Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Come on, skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My my my, my my my, my my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My my my, my my my, my my
Right in this moment, this order's tall

[Chorus]
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

[Verse 2]
Come on, skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My my my, my my my, my my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split
You might also like[Chorus]
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines

[Outro]
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?162Embed

When I Grow Up by The Pussycat Dolls

33 ContributorsWhen I Grow Up Lyrics[Intro: Nicole Scherzinger, R.City, DarkChild]
Boys call you sexy (What's up, sexy?)
And you don't care what they say (Ha, ha)
See, every time you turn around, they screaming your name
Just call you sexy (What's up, sexy?)
And you don't care what they say (Yeah)
See, every time you turn around, they screaming your name
(Right about now, Darkchild)

[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger, R.City]
Now I've got a confession (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
When I was young I wanted attention (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
And I promised myself that I'd do anything (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Anything at all for them to notice me (Ha, ha, ha, ha)

[Pre-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
But I ain't complaining (Oh)
We all wanna be famous (Oh)
So, go ahead and say what you wanna say (Oh)
You know what it's like to be nameless (Oh)
Want them to know what your name is (Oh)
'Cause see, when I was younger, I would say

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
When I grow up, I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star, I wanna be in movies
When I grow up, I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars, I wanna have groupies
When I grow up, be on TV
People know me, be on magazines
When I grow up, fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it, get it? (Hey)

They used to tell me I was silly (Ha, ha, ha, ha)

I always wanted to be a superstar (Superstar; Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Who knew that singing songs would get me this far? (La, la, la, la)

[Pre-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
But I ain't complaining (Oh)

No one can do it better
You can talk about me
'Cause I'm a hot topic
I see you watching me, watching me
And I know you want it

Yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, huh
That's how much I love you (Yeah; No, whoa, whoa, huh)
That's how much I need you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Rihanna & Ne-Yo, Both]
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile (Uh)
Can I not like you for a while? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl, and then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden, I forget (That I was upset)
I can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

[Chorus: Rihanna & Ne-Yo]
And I hate how much I love you, boy (Yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (Yeah, ooh whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so

Ooh, and you completely know the power that you have (The power that you have)
The only one that makes me laugh (One that makes me laugh)
Said that it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... (I)
Love you beyond the reason why (Why)
And it just ain't right, oh

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & Rihanna]
And I hate how much I love you, girl (Hey)
I can't stand how much I need you (Hey, hey)
And I hate how much I love you, girl (No)
But I just can't let you go (Ooh)
But I hate that I love you so

[Bridge: Rihanna & Ne-Yo, Both]
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (Hmm)
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah...
Ooh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Rihanna & Ne-Yo, Both]
That's how much I love you (How much I need you)
That's how much I need you (How much I love you)

That's how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you, boy (Hey!)
I can't stand how much I need you (Can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (Girl)
But I just can't let you go (But I just can't let you go, no)

Chasing Pavements by Adele

42 ContributorsTranslationsDanskEspañolPortuguêsChasing Pavements Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

[Chorus]
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

[Verse 2]
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?

[Chorus]
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah

See You Again by Miley Cyrus

31 ContributorsSee You Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got my sights set on you, and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 2]
I've got a way of knowin' when something is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
(I can't wait) Now I can't wait to see you again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa
I, I can't wait to see you again

When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm reading the signs
(That you can't wait) That you can't wait to see me again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa
I, I can't wait to see you again

[Bridge]
I got my sights set on you, and I'm ready to aim

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa
I, I can't wait to see you again
[Outro]
(To see you again)
(To see you again)
Oh-whoa-whoa
I, I can't wait to see you again17Embed

A-Punk by Vampire Weekend

49 ContributorsA-Punk Lyrics[Verse 1]
Johanna drove slowly into the city
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily-white hand
Showed no fear, she'd seen the thing
In the young men's wing at Sloan-Kettering

[Chorus]
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"

[Post-Chorus]
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey!

[Verse 3]
His Honor drove southward, seeking exotica
Down to the pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
Oh, oh, oh
You might also like[Verse 4]
I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea

[Chorus]
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"

[Outro]
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!30Embed

I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Oh, the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me

[Verse 1]
Ooh, girl, let's take it slow
So as for you, well, you know where to go
I wanna take my love and hate you 'til the end

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not like you to turn away
From all the bullshit I can't take
It's not like me to walk away

[Chorus]
I'm so addicted to

I see you, you're with him, he ain’t right but you don’t trip
You stand by while he lies then turn right round and forgive
I can’t take to see your face with those tears running down your cheeks
But what can I do? I gotta stay true 'cause deep down I’m still a G

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don’t wanna come between you and your man
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

Girl, I can’t help but wait 'til you get that with him, it don’t change
Can’t help but wait 'til you see that with me it ain’t the same
Can’t help but wait 'til you see you for what you really are
Baby girl, you are a star and I can’t help but wait

[Verse 2]
It ain't fresh to just let him call the shots
You’re a queen, you should be getting all that someone’s got
You should be rocking the latest in purses, bracelets and watches

A Milli by Lil Wayne

Bangladesh
Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers, "Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him"
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derrière
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, "Look at that bastard Weezy!"
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch, haha
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 3]
See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour, haha
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say "Life ain't shit without me"
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, 'cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me
I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat143Embed

Ooh, whoa, whoa
Oh, oh

I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time
Deep inside, it was a rush, what a rush (What a rush, rush)
'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way about me
Just too much, just too much (Just too much)

Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?
Do you catch a breath when I look at you?

Superstar (feat. Matthew Santos) by Lupe Fiasco, Matthew Santos

If you are what you say you are (Yeah, yeah)
A superstar (Gon' say now)
Then have no fear, the camera's here (Uh)
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh (The return)
If you are what you say you are
A superstar (Uh-huh)
Then have no fear, the crowd is here (Yeah)
And the lights are on (Ha)
And they want a show, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah (Free Chilly)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uh, a fresh, cool, young Lu'
Tryna cash his microphone check, two-one-two
Wanna believe my own hype, but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees; "What have you brung? You?
Did you improve on a design? Did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You—the more famous person—you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too!"
And then it hit me, standing outside of heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
"Go back, whatever you did, you undo."
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me two tons too
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha

Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid and (Pew!)
Out through China, nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)
Now, that's important to say
'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Uh)
They want everything back (Back) that they've paid
'Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha
[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along, and when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, "You need to go and see that!"
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased
And then, they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, "Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha"
"Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha"
[Chorus: Matthew Santos & Lupe Fiasco]
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh
If you are what you say you are
A superstar (Superstar)
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh, oh, oh, oh (Yeah)

It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops, I remember there was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows, they were watchin' while we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show, you'd better lie low

[Chorus]
If you love me, won't you let me know?

[Verse 2]
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals and a fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles, and a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armour
When I'm dead and hit the ground, my nerves are poles that unfroze

[Chorus]
And if you love me, won't you let me know?

The best thing 'bout tonight's that we're not fighting
Could it be that we have been this way before?
I know you don't think that I am trying
I know you're wearing thin down to the core

[Chorus]
But hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find

This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
You always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed, but I have loved you from the start

Oh, but hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again

The Man Who Can't Be Moved by The Script

45 ContributorsThe Man Who Can’t Be Moved Lyrics[Verse 1]
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?
And how can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

[Chorus]
'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving
I'm not moving

[Verse 2]
Policeman says, "Son, you can't stay here"
I say, "There's someone I'm waiting for
If it's a day, a month, a year"
Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go

[Chorus]
'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet

And you'll come running to the corner 'cause you know it's just for you

When I saw you getting down, girl, I hoped it was you
And when I look into your eyes, I knew it was true (Hahaha)

It's Not My Time by 3 Doors Down

14 ContributorsIt’s Not My Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me lovin' all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the current's only pulling me down
It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this?

[Chorus]
'Cause it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won't go

[Verse 2]
I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away
Oh, but I'm taking them back
'Cause all this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend, this life we live, it's not what we have
It's what we believe in

Hurry up and wait
So close, but so far away
Everything
That you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste, but you just can't touch

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
(No one knows your name yet)
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it

In your face, and the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated (Frustrated)
And you're getting all kind of impatient (Impatient)
Waitin' (Waitin')

We live and we learn
To take one step at a time

But while she sleep I sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go out, she shut down the whole set

She like to do her own hair and get her own checks
My bust it baby, I keep her on deck

This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands just take the wheel
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead

[Chorus]
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see?

[Verse 2]
They're trying to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now

No matter what you say about love
I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire
Sooner or later, I get what I'm askin' for
No matter what you say about life
I learn every time I bleed
The truth is a stranger, soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free

[Pre-Chorus]
To admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on
And leave you behind

[Chorus]
I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

Well, it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Bridge]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Put your lovin' hand out, baby

Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

[Verse 1: Tshawe Baqwa]
Ridin' high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
Walked away, wonderin' then
Would easy come, and easy go, and it would end?

[Verse 2: Yosef Wolde-Mariam, Tshawe Baqwa]
So, why any time I leave, ya let me go?
Any time I reach, ya get me low?
Any time I seek, ya let me know?
But I planted that seed, just let me grow

I hope that my heart gets fed

Shadow of my life was hangin' over me

Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're on a runway track from the good
I want it painted, a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like the heart ain't attached where it should
You done gave it away, you had it 'til you took it back

Punk ass motherfucker
Check this shit out
Chu was gon' do? kill me in my sleep, you bitch ass nigga?!
2Pac, Biggie, shut the fuck up!
Fuckin' dogs, barkin' and shit
(Don't shoot, don't shoot)
Fuck you, nigga
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' 'til I'm tired 'cause they said
"You ain't grindin' until you tired"
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find, a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you don' took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right?
My life

[Verse 1: The Game & Lil Wayne]
Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away
Like I overdosed on cocaineor take me away
Like a bullet from Kurt Cobain, suicide
I'm from a windy city like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces? (My life)
‘Cause that's Jesus, people
And Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel, yeah
Like Roc-A-Fella needed Sigel, like I needed my father
But he needed a needle (My life)
I need some meditation so I can lead my people
They askin', "Why
Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?"
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle

[Verse 2: The Game & Lil Wayne]
We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24s spinnin'? I earned 'em
And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson, ‘cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile (My life)
Damn, I know his mama proud, and since you helped me sell my dream
We can share my mama now
And like M.J.B., no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mind state, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty, like a Glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' 'til I'm tired ‘cause they said
"You ain't grindin' until you tired"
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide

[Verse 3: The Game & Lil Wayne]
Walk through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts
Listenin' to the Chronic album
Playin' backwards, shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge (Compton, Compton)
Made my grandmother pray for good, it never made her happy
But I bet that new Mercedes could (My life)
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should (My life)
With the top back
In my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I still keep this motherfucker cocked back
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' 'til I'm tired ‘cause they said
"You ain't grindin' until you tired"
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find, a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you don' took so many of my people

It was love from above, that could save me from hell

Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands
And we sang

With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home, with them real big hips
You so right I'm gon' beat
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say shh"
See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it was no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have an eruption
