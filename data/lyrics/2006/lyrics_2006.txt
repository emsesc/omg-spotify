[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Hey, girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy (Huh-uh)

A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country (Huh-uh)
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
We leave the whole club jazzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
It's the Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats, boats (No fightin')
[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie, and I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto (No fighting)
Oh, you know I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie, and I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

What you see in her you ain't seen in me
But I guess it was all just make believe

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And I pray to God He hears you, and

[Verse 3]
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Gotta change my answering machine

Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

Cryin' over you

Welcome to the Black Parade by My Chemical Romance

243 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolРусскийWelcome to the Black Parade Lyrics[Intro]
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them, your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade"
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?"
[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times, I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, and let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end, we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

[Bridge]
On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, ha, ha)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, ha, ha)
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all

[Breakdown]
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
And give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
Just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
Just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, you'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated

You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh-huh, that's right
I took your words, and I believed
In everything you said to me
Yeah-huh, that's right

[Chorus]
If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong
I know better 'cause you said forever
And ever, who knew?

Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool?
Oh no, no, no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you, friend
I'd give anything

'Fore they're long gone

Woo! Shady, Aftermath
Look at that bitch
Oh, shit, hey (Damn)

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Nate Dogg]
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk
Get fucked up, hit the strip club
Don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, get fucked
Get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass, I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

To rise above and beat it

I said, who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards, I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a drivin' ban
Amongst some other offences
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?

Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and starin' at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
"I'm sorry, love, I'll have to turn you down"
And oh, he must be up to summat
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feelin' in my stomach
And start to wonder what his story might be

Before Cam got the shit to pop

Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine

Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"

Before anybody wanted K. West beats

Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on

But boy, you know your begging don't fool me
Because to you, it's just a game
(You know it's just too little too late)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So let me on down
'Cause time has made me strong
I'm starting to move on
I'm gonna say this now
Your chance has come and gone
And you know...

[Chorus]
It's just too little too late
A little too wrong, and I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
You know it's just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me, you just like the chase
To be real, it doesn't matter anyway

You got a problem
But don't come asking me for help

Unfaithful by Rihanna

49 ContributorsUnfaithful Lyrics[Verse 1]
Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

Over My Head (Cable Car) by The Fray

44 ContributorsOver My Head (Cable Car) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

[Chorus]
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

[Verse 2]
Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

Everyone knows I'm in

With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on, on

[Bridge]
And suddenly, I've become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless
Without a sound, we lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down 'til we torch it ourselves

[Chorus]
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind

Everyone knows

Everyone knows I'm in

Everyone knows I'm in

Goodbye My Lover by James Blunt

34 ContributorsGoodbye My Lover Lyrics[Verse 1]
Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
Cause I saw the end before we'd begun
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by yours
I've kissed your lips and held your hand
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

[Chorus]
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend

I am a dreamer and when I wake
You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you
I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bare my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet

Can't keep believing, we're only deceiving ourselves
And I'm sick of the lie

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're too late

[Chorus]
Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

[Verse 2]
Couldn't take the blame, sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game
Selfishly hated, no wonder you're jaded
You can't play the victim this time

And you're too late

[Chorus]
So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

[Bridge]
You never call me when you're sober
You only want it 'cause it's over, it's over
How could I have burned paradise?
How could I, you were never mine

[Chorus]
So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
Don't lie to me
Just get your things
I've made up your mind16Embed

Look around the club, what do I see
Everybody rockin' side to side to the beat
Snappin' they fingers, bouncin' to the groove
All by they self, that's the new move
Nigga, where I'm from, we like to go dumb
I'm soakin' up the game, I'm seein' how it's done

Straight from Bankhead, I said 'you good at it'

Rollin' up the kush, put it in the air

Pull out the ol' school 'cause I'm feelin' real cool
Yeah I'm from the 'A', so I'm leanin' and rockin'

Remember how this used to be

I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Baby, let's get closer, tonight

Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure, I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me

Oh, an' I've found, that I'm bound
To wander down that one-way road
Oh, and I realise all about your lies

Be Without You - Kendu Mix by Mary J. Blige

3 ContributorsBe Without You (Kendu Mix) LyricsI wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oooo (oh, oh, oh, oh) oooo

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
'Cuz a love like this takes some time

People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)

It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real shit (yes)
See baby we been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cuz I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby
See Mary J. Blige LiveGet tickets as low as $270You might also likeI got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? (no)

Make me cry? (no)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)

I'll be faithful (yes)

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting, stand back

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes, I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly, I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without?
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?
Well, did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
See, we hurt each other, then we do it again
You say love is a temple, love is a higher law
Love is a temple, love is a higher law
You ask for me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't keep holding on to what you've got
'Cause all you got is hurt

[Verse 4: Bono & Mary J Blige]

So I'm gonna let it do all the talking

I felt a little fear upon my back
I said, "Don't look back, just keep on walking"

You Know I'm No Good by Amy Winehouse

100 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisYou Know I’m No Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 2]
Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinkin' on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet ya, chips and pita
You say, "When we married"
'Cause you're not bitter
"There'll be none of him no more"
I cried for you on the kitchen floor
You might also like[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 3]
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soap my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drop and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first?

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yeah, you know that I'm no good65Embed

I'm not saying it was your fault

Oh, that every time I look inside

When I'm Gone by Eminem

290 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoTürkçePortuguêsDeutschAzərbaycanca / آذربايجانWhen I’m Gone Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy, look what I made!" "Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself"
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"
"Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more" "Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
"Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya!"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late."
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and "Thank you all for comin' out"
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!"
"But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?"
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'."
"But baby, wait!" – "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real."
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die, Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

Pullin' Me Back by Chingy, Tyrese

12 ContributorsPullin’ Me Back Lyrics[Chorus: Tyrese]
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go, something keeps telling me that (me that)
Everything gon be all right
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work

It was all good at first, spendin' money, goin' shoppin'
Eatin' at the finest restaurants, and if I'm club hoppin'
She was right thur wit me bottle poppin' livin' that life (livin' that life)

Tears Dry On Their Own by Amy Winehouse

55 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisTears Dry on Their Own Lyrics[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Verse 1]
All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right, when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 2]
I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)

Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 3]
I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, my blue shade
My tears dry on their own
Woah, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry on their own, woah
[Outro]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, my deep shade

And now I look a fool for thinking you were on my side

Sometimes
It's hard to know where I stand
It's hard to know where I am
Well, maybe it's a puzzle I don't understand

But sometimes
I get the feeling that I'm
Stranded in the wrong time
Where love is just a lyric in a children's rhyme
A sound bite

I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (with Flowers in My Hair) by Sandi Thom

10 ContributorsI Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (with Flowers in My Hair) Lyrics[Chorus]
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker
With flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69
Revolution was in the air
I was born too late
To a world that doesn’t care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker
With flowers in my hair

[Verse 1]
When the head of state didn’t play guitar
Not everybody drove a car
When music really mattered
And when radio was king
When accountants didn’t have control
And the media couldn’t buy your soul
And computers were still scary and
We didn’t know everything

[Chorus]
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker
With flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69
Revolution was in the air
I was born too late
To a world that doesn’t care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker
With flowers in my hair
You might also like[Verse 2]
When pop stars still remained a myth
And ignorance could still be bliss
And when God saved the Queen
She turned a whiter shade of pale
My mom and dad were in their teens
And anarchy was still a dream
And the only way to stay in touch
Was a letter in the mail

[Chorus]
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker
With flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69
Revolution was in the air
I was born too late
To a world that doesn’t care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker
With flowers in my hair

[Verse 3]
When record shops were still on top
And vinyl was all that they stocked
And the super info highway
Was still drifting out in space
Kids were wearing hand-me-downs
And playing games meant kick arounds
And footballers still had long hair
And dirt across their face
[Chorus (Extended)]
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker
With flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69
Revolution was in the air
I was born too late
To a world that doesn’t care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker
With flowers in my hair
I was born too late
To a world that doesn’t care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker
With flowers in my hair1Embed

Where'd You Go (feat. Holly Brook & Jonah Matranga) by Fort Minor, Holly Brook, Jonah Matranga

38 ContributorsWhere’d You Go Lyrics[Intro: Holly Brook]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said, "Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself tryin' to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot working my day around a call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

[Chorus: Holly Brook & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But, now, you only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine and I'm planning to keep it that way
And you can call me if you find that you have something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll tell you I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

[Chorus: Holly Brook & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it
[Chorus: Holly Brook & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

[Intro: Lina Rafn]
(From Paris to Berlin

'Cause when I'm thinking of you
And all the things we could do
My heart is pumping for love
You left me longing for you, you, you)

Patience is a game
And every night, I say your name
Hoping that you'll answer

You brought me out of control

Teasing was the thing

If and when I found you, but I don't
I've got no clue

I Don't Feel Like Dancin' by Scissor Sisters

25 ContributorsI Don’t Feel Like Dancin’ Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning with a head like, "What ya done?"
This used to be the life, but I don't need another one
You like cuttin' up and carryin' on, you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up gettin' down?

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll play along when I hear that special song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right
You'd better move when you're swingin' 'round the room
Looks like the magic's only ours tonight

[Chorus]
But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today
I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you

[Verse 2]
Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colours it'd make a blind man so confused
So why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I'd lose?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
Just please understand when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around, I'm sure that I'll be fine

[Chorus]
But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today
I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you

[Bridge]
You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound
Just lay me down
As you float away into the shimmer lights

[Chorus]
But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today
I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'

And all the wants and all the needs
All I don't want to need at all

The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted on this evening
I give the final blow

When darkness turns to light

A falling star, at least I fall alone
I can't explain what you can't explain
You're finding things that you didn't know
I look at you with such disdain

You see, my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it

The Rose by Westlife

11 ContributorsThe Rose Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some say love it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love it is a flower
And you its only seed

[Verse 2]
It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

[Verse 3]
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the roseSee Westlife LiveGet tickets as low as $77You might also likeEmbed

Come to me, I can be, what you need, ooh baby
It's Bad Boy, bitch
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
(It feels good to be back, I missed ya)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Relax your mind, let your conscious be free
And I roll with the sounds of the BBE
Just do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
(You know what time it is)
(Report to the dance floor)
It's Bad Boy, bitch
(Talk to 'em)

[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger]
See you out the corner of my eye
Leanin' on the wall lookin' fly
I want you to come be with me
You're the only one I wanna talk to, but I don't wanna rush

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
I'm here, when will you make your move?
I see you eyein' me, I want cha, why don't cha?

Security strapped, still stackin' a million
Stunt with a stallion, somethin' Italian
Or maybe Puerto Rican, you can catch me in Paris
I'm in it to win it, I'm willin' to carry
The game, if you think I'm not, look at the carats (Look at me, man)
Hop up clean up outta the Phantom
The people go screamin' like an opera anthem (Let's go)
I did it before, do it again (Do it again)
I got it to blow, got it to spend (Got it to spend)
Fly as befo', cool as the wind
Got hits go back like Juice and Gin, yeah
Shine the best and diamond necklace (c'mon)
My extravagant taste, the style perplexes
They know I'm the shit, they wanna get next
That's why she havin' a fit cause she wanted to get next to him

She be waitin' anticipatin' for oh so long
Fantasizing wild thoughts of me comin' on like
(I'm here, when will you make your move?)
She diggin' my style, my swag, my suede, my swerve
My way with words, the boy's absurd for sure
You can't fall 'til my aura call her
I make miracles like I walk on water
What you want mama order, it's on my tab
I'm so bad with the cash, I dropped a whole bag
Where you at, girl?

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
I'm here, when will you make your move?
I see you eyein' me, I want cha, why don't cha?

You were the one who stole my heart (You were the one)
Can't you see the wait is over

I need you to come closer
This feeling is getting strong
(Oh, boy) You really got me hot

You Give Me Something by James Morrison

17 ContributorsYou Give Me Something Lyrics[Verse 1]
You only stay with me in the morning
You only hold me when I sleep
I was meant to tread the water
But now I've gotten in too deep
For every piece of me that wants you
Another piece backs away

[Chorus 1]
'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared alright
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something
'Cause someday I might know my heart

[Verse 2]
You only waited up for hours
Just to spend a little time alone with me
And I can say I've never bought you flowers
I can't work out what they mean
I never thought that I'd love someone
That was someone else's dream

[Chorus 2]
As you give me something
That makes me scared alright
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try
Please give me something
'Cause someday I might call you from my heart

Ooh, let me slow it down so you can catch the flow
Screw it up, make it go extra slow

Touch down on me, throw it up like a pro
I ride the beat like a bicycle, I'm icy cold

What's Left Of Me by Nick Lachey

7 ContributorsWhat’s Left of Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Watch my life pass me by
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time, are becoming clearer
I don't wanna waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes
Yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

[Verse 2]
I've been dying inside
Little by little
Nowhere to go, but going out of my mind
In endless circles
Running from myself until
You gave me a reason for standing still

[Chorus]
And I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

Tell me it's not all in my head
Take what's left of this man
Make me whole, once again

[Chorus]
'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
You can have all that's left
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What's left of me
Oh, oh, oh-oh

[Outro]
I've been dying inside, you see
I'm going out of my mind, out of my mind
I'm just running in circles all the time
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?
Just running in circles in my mind
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?
Take what's left of me9Embed
