Oh, baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

That is just so typically me
Ooh, baby, baby

Breathe by Faith Hill

I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face and I've
Never been this swept away

[Verse 1]
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

[Chorus]
And I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

[Verse 2]
In a way, I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
I'm closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

In the End by Linkin Park

It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

[Verse 1]
All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'ma live my life like I should (Like I should)
Now all the critics wanna hit it
Ya shit can how we did it, just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from these critics
But do we always gotta cry?
Do we always gotta live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast that's movin' really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid? So what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run when you're starin' down the cable of a
Mic pointed at your grill like a gun?
Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set
It's like Russian Roulette, when you're placin', you bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done

Or the combination for this life and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason (Everything happens for a reason)
I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fists
And everybody wanna run (Wanna run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (Hide from the gun)
You can take that ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take the edge off the knife (No, sir!)
And now you want your money back (Your money back)
But you're denied 'cause your brain's fried from the sack
And there ain't nothin' I can do
'Cause life is a lesson, you learn it when you're through

Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, "Motherfuck the police!"
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)

Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?

Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what?
It's gonna be me

[Verse 2: JC with Chris & Justin]
You got no choice, babe
But to move on, you know
There ain't no time to waste
But you're just too blind (too blind)
To see
But in the end, you know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me why...

Baby, when you finally ('ly)
Get to love somebody (somebody)
Guess what?
It's gonna be me

[Interlude: Justin]
(It's gonna be me)
Ay, ay, ayy
Ooh yeah, yeah

There comes a day
When I'll be the one
You'll see
Lance: It's gonna...
Joey: Gonna...
Justin: Gonna...
JC: Gonna...
Chris: Gonna
It's gonna be me
[Bridge: All, Justin]

Couldn't find your man, he was chillin' with his homies
This weekend you're goin' out
If he try to stop you, you're goin' off

Big Pimpin' by JAY-Z, UGK

172 ContributorsBig Pimpin’ Lyrics[Produced by Timbaland]

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
It's big pimpin', baby (That's right)
It's big pimpin', spendin' Gs
Feel me, uh-huh uh, uh-huh
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
You know I
Thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss, I'm breezin'
Talkin' 'bout, "What's the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust and believe 'im
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts, then it's
"Beep beep," then I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
So you can be livin' it up? Shit, I
Parts with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen
I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins
I got no passion
I got no patience, and I hate waitin'
Ho, get your ass in, and
[Refrain: JAY-Z]
Let's ride!
Check 'em out now
Ride
Yea, and let' ride!
Check 'em out now
Ride!

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
Yea, we doin'
Big pimpin'
We spendin' cheese, check 'em out now

Nigga, it's the
Big Southern rap empresario
Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's "my scenario"
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say: "There he go!"
Now these ma'fuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho's there out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But, nigga, if you hate now
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get your ass to the back as I fly to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Posted up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's sip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!
[Chorus 2: Bun B, Pimp C]
We be
Big pimpin'
Spendin' cheese, we be

Jigga Man, Pimp C
And B-U-N B (Uh,) nigga
[Verse 3: Pimp C, Bun B]
Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it "buck"
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck wit' y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uh, now what y'all
Know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise (We be)

7 Days by Craig David

36 Contributors7 Days Lyrics[Intro]
You know what?
Got something to say
Craig David
7 days
Check it out, yeah

[Verse 1]
On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me (Oh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body (Body)
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her a name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

[Pre-Chorus]
Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age twenty-four
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say?
She said she'd, "Love to rendezvous"
She asked me, "What we were gonna do?"
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

[Verse 2]
Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker
She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it
(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)
And I, oh-oh, I, yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Ooh, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a man to play around, baby (Ooh, yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl, hmm, you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat 'for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing off my phone
When you're feeling all alone
All you gotta do
Is just call me, call me
[Chorus]
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

[Bridge]
(Break it down, break it down)
Since I met this special lady
Ooh, yeah
I can't get her off my mind
She's one of a kind
And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kind of thing
With you, oh

[Chorus]
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

An empty street, an empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone, the rooms are getting smaller
I wonder how, I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had, the songs we sang together
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: All, Shane]
And oh, my love
I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far

[Chorus: All]
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue
To see you once again, my love
Overseas from coast to coast
To find a place I love the most
Where the fields are green
To see you once again, my love

[Verse 2: Brian]
I try to read, I go to work
I'm laughing with my friends
But I can't stop, to keep myself from thinking, oh no
I wonder how, I wonder why
I wonder where they are

Mmmm, I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
(Come on)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

[Verse 1]
Mmmm, you can find me in St. Louis rollin' on dubs
Smokin' on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like Cocoa Puffs
Sippin' Bud', gettin' perved and gettin' dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, accumulated enough scratch just to
Navigate it, wood decorated on chrome and it's
Candy painted, fans faintin' while I'm entertainin'
Wild, ain't it? How me and money get acquainted
Plus I hang with Hannibal Lecter (Hot shit)
So feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (What?), I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause, I'm righteous, above the law
Player my style's raw, I'm Born to Mack, like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamour, give me D's with a rubber hammer
My grammar be's Ebonics, gin, tonic and chronic
Fuck Bionic, it's ironic, slammin' niggas like Onyx
Lunatics 'til the day I die
And I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

Tell me why I can't be there where you are?

Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)

Absolutely (Story of a Girl) - Radio Mix by Nine Days

2 ContributorsAbsolutely (Story Of A Girl) - Radio Mix LyricsThis is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises, never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror, so how do you choose?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

Now how many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this shit day after day?
How did we wind up this way?
Watching our mouths for the words that we say
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose
How do we get there today?
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes
You might also likeYour clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her when she smiles

Well, your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her

This is the story of a girl
Her pretty face, she hid from the world
And while she looked so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles
When she smilesEmbed

Uh, say what? say what? say what?
So baby tell me what's up
Can we ascend to higher heights
And when the path gets rough
We can give into brighter nights breathe with peace
Expound by leaps, and soul to reap, our souls to keep
The passion's deep, and filled with heat
Living this life on the hustle, I barely get enough time
You know me from the platinum, how I stack them and shine
You see a lot of contenders, they try to end up in my world
A reputation known as the untouchable girl
I'm moving on now, trying to make a change in my ways
Be the best that I can be to last me all of my days
Now we can blaze pathways or just take our time
Better holla if ya hear me cause Left Eye gon' shine
My eyes don't lie, see how they glisten when you pass me by
You and I don't need permission to be unified
Surely I done seen and heard of many places
Then I travelled around the world, seen many faces
Don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true
And show me that nobody else can do it better than you
So if you're serious, I'm curious to see what you got
But love is furious cause I believe in blowing up spots
[Hook: Donell Jones]
I'm digging you and I'm feeling you
And you know what's up
Said I'm diggin' you and I'm wanting you
So tell me what's up

I got two strong arms
Blessings of Babylon
Time to carry on
And try for sins and false alarms
So, to America, the brave
Wise men save

[Chorus]
Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of Aran goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion, there's a wrong and a right
Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of Aran goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion, there's a wrong and a right
He'll never, never fight over you

With just a song of mine
To keep from burning history
Seasons of gasoline and gold
Wise men fold

Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of Aran goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion, there's a wrong and a right
He'll never, never fight over you

The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town

The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed

Never settle for the path of least resistance

It Feels So Good by Sonique

16 ContributorsIt Feels So Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
You always make me smile when I'm feeling down
You give me such a vibe, it's totally bonafide, mm
It's not the way you walk and it ain't the way you talk
It ain't the job you got, that keeps me satisfied

[Chorus]
(Your love, it feels so good) And that's what takes me high
(Higher than I've been before) Your love, it keeps me alive
(Thought I should let you know) That your touch, it means so much
(When I'm alone at night) It's you I'm always thinking of, ooh, oh, baby

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I want you to understand
How I feel, yeah, deep inside
Oh-ho, you make me feel
What I need to feel, yes, in my heart

[Chorus]
(Your love, it feels so good) And that's what takes me high
(Higher than I've been before) Your love, it keeps me alive
(Thought I should let you know) That your touch, it means so much
(When I'm alone at night) It's you I'm always thinking of, ooh, oh, baby

Incomplete by Sisqo

11 ContributorsIncomplete Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh yeah yeah, uh
Listen

[Verse 1]
Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still, I'm lonely now
Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers, wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

[Chorus]
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you, girl, my life is incomplete
Said, without you girl, ahh

Girl, I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was
It's been a year, winter, summer, spring and fall
But bein' without you just ain't livin' ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

[Chorus]
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

That without you, girl, my life is incomplete
Oh yeah, that without you, girl, ahh

But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything, ha
And everything
To hear you say
That you'll stay
[Chorus]
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars

But I can't pretend that I don't see (Yeah, yeah)

Everything You Want by Vertical Horizon

26 ContributorsEverything You Want Lyrics[Verse 1]
Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh, and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

[Chorus 1]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away the
Anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time

Watching the stars on the big screen
Then he lies awake and he wonders
"Why can’t that be me?"

But just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?

Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream

On a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold onto
That’s all she needs

Fill Me In by Craig David

30 ContributorsFill Me In Lyrics[Intro]
I got something to say, got something to say
Alright (Can you fill me in?)
Come on
Can you fill me in?
What you want? What you want me to do, baby?
Can you fill me in?
Let's talk about it

[Verse 1]
I was checkin' this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned, said, "Hey boy, come on right around"
So I knock at the door
You were standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean, me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, "Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?"
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (It's another one, it's another one)

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, "Hey girl, come on right around"
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean, me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, "Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door"
Can you fill me in? (Fill me in)
Wearing a jacket, whose property?
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (Can you tell me?)
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)
[Bridge]
All they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby
(Craig David)
Watchin' our every move
Think someday they might approve, baby

[Chorus]
"Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)"
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)17Embed

When I'm lost in the rain
In your eyes I know I'll find the light
To light my way
And when I'm scared
And losing ground
When my world is going crazy
You can turn it all around
And when I'm down you're there
Pushing me to the top
You're always there
Giving me all you've got

For everything that's true
I turn to you

I just reach for you and

Where I Wanna Be by Donell Jones

16 ContributorsWhere I Wanna Be Lyrics[Verse 1]
I just left my baby girl a message
Sayin', "I won't be comin' home, I'd rather be alone"
She doesn't fully understand me
'Cause I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she give me some time, I can be the man she needs
But there's a lotta lust inside of me and we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her, but I need
Some time to be alone

[Chorus]
But when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
She's cryin' her heart to me, how could you let this be?
I just need time to see where I wanna be
Where I wanna be

[Post-Chorus]
Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee
I don't mean to hurt you, baby
Oh, no, no

[Verse 2]
Never did I imagine
That you would play a major part in a decision that's so hard
Do I leave? Do I stay? Do I go?
Or think about my life and what matters to me the most?
Girl, the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not sayin' I'm gone, but I
Have to find what life is like without you

Come on
Oh, yeah..
Uh
Never be the same again

[Verse 1]
I call you up whenever things go wrong
You're always there you are my shoulder to cry on
I can't believe it took me quite so long
To take the forbidden step
Is this something that I might regret?

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on, come on
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
You are the one
The lonely heart that can't be tamed
Come on, come on
I'm hoping that you feel the same (Yeah!)
This is something that I can't forget

[Chorus]
I thought that we would just be friends
Things will never be the same again
It's just the beginning it's not the end
Things will never be the same again
It's not a secret anymore
Now we've opened up the door
Starting tonight and from now on
We'll never, never be the same again

Uh, check it
Night and day
Black beach sand to red clay
The US to UK
NYC to LA
From sidewalks to highways
See it will never be the same, what I'm saying
My mind frame never changed so you came and rearranged
But sometimes it seems completely forbidden
To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden
When there's no competition
And you render my condition
Though improbable it's not impossible
For a love that could be unstoppable, but wait
I find lines between fate and destiny
Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be?
When you tell me the stories of your quest for me
Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly
And as our energies mix and begin to multiply
Everyday situations they start to simplify
So things will never be the same between you and I
We intertwine our life forces
And now we’re unified (yeah)
[Chorus]
I thought that we would just be friends
Things will never be the same again
It's just the beginning it's not the end
Things will never be the same again
It's not a secret anymore
Now we've opened up the door
Starting tonight and from now on
We'll never, never be the same again

Come on, come on
Our things will never be the same again
You are the one
Never be the same again

Against All Odds (Take A Look at Me Now) - Mariah Only by Mariah Carey

7 ContributorsRone vs. Charron Lyrics{Charron chooses to go first}

[Round 1: Charron]
I said, welcome home Rone
Feels like King Of The Dot to me
Corey/Adam let’s give the whites what they want to see
Two chromes, TEC's will hit you
Someone get Joseph Kahn make this set official
This time your getting Bodied Adam, this is revenge for Pistolz
Cans up let’s do cheers
So many shots he thinks it's New Years
Get ICE'd so hard you'll quit battling for two years
You quit like a sore loser, the fans just wait around
Since 2017 bitch, you haven’t made a sound
People are out here, but know they can't just wait around
Man this is welcome to your retirement home, I'm Grandma's Favorite now
I put that on Agnes and Bertha, they heard I’m invincible
Every grandma's giving me this round: Werther's Originals
Right now, his grandma's like, "Rone. Stop it dear
Your birthday card will get no guap this year."
It’s getting quiet for your Grammy; Soul Khan's career
Have him wrapped in plastic like the couch in your grandma's basement
Your whole family’s racist
I’ve killed so many Smack rappers I’m your grandpa's favorite
Fuckin'....MGK-K-K
Nah, that's an angle I can't try
You reversed racism I can’t lie
Cause he dressed up as Lincoln and got his chain taken by a black guy
This that white in white crime
You were the biggest cokehead in all of Grind Time
If that was the truth, Hollohan switch over to my side
What? Again?
I'm just prayin' this man's lucky
The only person to come (cum) from behind Rone is Sandusky
You asked 'Ganik for more money, gave him all kind of quotes
He flew me first class, he made you ride the coach
He like, "Bro, that's a piece of cake, that's the cheapest angle he can take."
Well if you don’t like rape jokes then stopped being raped
He's like, "Be more creative next time. My name wasn't in the headlines
He never gave me red wine before bed time
You're from Philly - if it wasn’t Sandusky, it was Tech-9
You blew Pat in a Cadillac, why was it filmed for?
His throat's still sore
We saw Adam choke in (choking) the Caddy; Happy Gilmore
In a press conference you told Head ICE, "I suck your dick. Straight like that, and guess what Wolf, it tastes like Pat."
Rone fans we need to see you
Y'all need to hold this L...GBTQ
I mean, you gave head to Head and blew Pat Stay too?
That’s gay dude
We're all waiting for you to come out like your SMACK debut
Used to be the man now you background
Represent Philly worse than the SMACK crowd
Do your virgin jokes, they'll react loud
You think I've never touched a pussy? Well I have now
Do your sports references real slow this a 3-0
Field goal, flip shit I’m Madden with the hit stick
Fuckin' up his return this the squib kick
You need pallbearers, I'll pick six
6 zip that’s mean I got this oat down I’m bout kick shit
Pistolz with that big shit, Sig' gripped
Johnny Manziel first round bust on this rich kid
Don’t play Pistolz he don’t listen to the same whistle
Get laced out and turn bitch; Ray Finkle
This guy ain’t a motherfuckin' MC
I know everything he’s 'bout to say against me
I am Autistic I do rap about guns
I did sell furnaces door to door like a scum
And have a dumb friend named 100 Bulletz that got me slapped over a cap gun
I did get jumped, K-Shine's still a chump
And Shotty Horroh did fuck my girl
I still killed every SMACK rapper in the whole fuckin' world
I told the URL "I have a small dick" I say it proudly
{Crowd starts shouting}
I told the URL "I don't have a small dick", I won't say it proudly
I act gangster and wear suits wrong, fuck y'all if you doubt me
I’m bout to sell your grandma a furnace I don’t wanna win I’m outtie
I’m 8 Miles ahead of you, tell them something they don’t know about me

I've been battle rapping for 10 years, someone shoot me in the face
What am I doing with my life?
I'm fuckin' fat now
Plus my comeback's versus Charron, I'm doin' bad, wow
I mean, wasn't I supposed to make a run off rap?
TV shows, movies, dumb contracts
Stand up, radio, #1 podcast
Sold out concert, wait...I done all that
See I don't do it for the fame like my enemy does
I'll put a bone through your cheek like an elephant tusk
And I don't do it for the cash cause my cheddar been up
Oh, I'm just doin' this for the adrenaline rush
So what's up? I know you been watchin' me walk
On the sack (Sac') for 10 years like Vlade Divac
Two call outs, three calls outs, I said, "Fuck it he's unstable."
Four call outs, five call outs, I'm gettin' up from the lunch table
But first, a history lesson
Your name was Triple C until you ever heard of me
And then you changed it to Ch-Rone two months after I hit the scene
And while that might all seem above board, Travis
Imagine a battle rapper came out named "Ch-Organik"
I would probably bother you, but I always show Buddy Love
Just clumped (Klump'd) him with the rest, never let push come to shove
But somehow, you turned into this little brother to me
Who'd always want to compete
Who'd always tug at my sleeve
The bother, the little toddler, the fly buzzing at me
Food stuck in my teeth, the tag under my tee
The terrible combination of awkward and cocky
Chronically sloppy, sonically off beat
Every single day you should curse God for your body
Your cringe worthy demeanor his this tailored for the perfect take down
But the second hand awkwardness of sharing the stage with you made me want to turn the plate down
We watched you grow up from a boy, you have a perverts face now
Any character assassination would be a nervous breakdown
Yo, your eye's movin', how he's quivering like it's puberty that crippled him
He's a wet noodle, a drenched poodle, a drooping piece of licorice
From your shoulders to your arms, how you move them like an idiot
If we were judging off body language, bro you would be illiterate
But his karate action arms, that's his true talent
Throw him some melons while he's rappin' he'll make a fruit salad
But I'm not here to make an impression of you, I'm here to make an impression on you
To prove that none of your family matters, don't your uncle or auntie (anti) matter
I'm unstable, I'm Billy Idol minus the Stratocaster
I'll put a foreigner through the rafters, I'm the coroner for these rappers
It's a champ versus a stepping stool, I'm the former you're the latter (ladder)
Bro, you always wanted my chains, well today we can fulfill that
You never have to win a title, I'll leave you permanently stilled champ
See, I am offended at any list where your name is ranked ahead of me
I am resentful of anyone that puts you in the same breath as me
The only chance you'd ever be ranked ahead of me is alphabetically, so thank the letter "C"
It's gon' be agony like you were at Gethsemane
You should be banned indefinitely like Randy Gregory
I'm here to get under your skin like an appendectomy or Patrick Beverley
Bro you have the personality of a patch of celery
You should've been an abandoned pregnancy
You misunderstood your girl's Tinder bio when she said she wanted to be challenged mentally
He's been chasin' me for so long, it's really got me in a whirlwind
It's got me wonderin', who's really your white whale?
Me? Or your little girlfriend?
I mean, he think that's whore's a looker cause she look like some sorta hooker
It's no wonder that he get Jersey'd as soon as Corey book her (Cory Booker)
But you came a long way from Laura Tarsi
We look back and still laugh
You used to have a fake girlfriend, now your new one is real fat
But your jokes? Stolen
Concepts? Stolen
Wordplay? Stolen
And he thinks all of it's fine
He can't go one battle without repurposing someone else's good idea, shit, probably mine
So for your raps 'bout sellin' drugs to the bars that Corey still in (stealin')
I might have to take a hand off since he act like Corey Dillon
But you said I turned my back on battle rap, we need to stop the cap
You're actin' like I robbed the culture with a gun and a stocking mask
I've had battle rappers on my phone suicidal, I'm the one that they called to chat
It wasn't the King Of The Dot Facebook group, I'm the one talking back
I see a battle rapper down, no problem, I offer cash
I had them eating off my plate, when you wouldn't offer scraps
GoFundMe's, tickets, PayPerViews, no problem I'm droppin' racks
I put my money where my mouth is, what's more King Of The Dot than that?
Bro you could never match my moves, either in or out the ring
They call me Roney Bae The Price, but to you, I'll always be the king
[Round 2: Charron]
Hey man, he always tellin' me my hands are out of place
Philly losin' 'Back 2 Back', this is Meek Mill when he battlin' Drake
He said I'm makin' fruit salad, but you dressed in purple, put the strap in his face
Man I'll have this fruit on the wall; Alexander The Grape
And you keep doin' a lot of gay jokes, man I don't know why y'all playin'
You said my girlfriend is fat, how many times have I told you we're not datin'
So Organik hit his phone up
For two years he never showed up
I’m not surprised he split that’s what atoms (Adams) do when they blow up
But, I’m not out here exposing you
You already done that
I’m not hurt you moved on from battling that’s what your supposed to do
I’m mad that once you made it, you didn't put on anyone that’s close to you
See, I helped Carter with Wild N' Out we trained a lot
I told Ward, "Come here if you wanna take my spot."
If I had your platform, do you know how many names I'd drop?
Once you get a Barstool you’re supposed to start takin' shots
A real king would've came back to start raisin' his stock
You're an NFL blocker, you should know when you drop the ball the game doesn’t stop
You are not one of us
Who was on your number one podcast? Not one of us
Doesn’t matter if you’re GZ I’m still supportin' you
Go to war with you
You want me cause MTV can do more for you
The midget in Joker you need a killer to open up doors for you
I have more money and still do this for fun
You’re from Philly you should know where your Roots started from
I got a bone to pick with him look what you have become
On God, I'll make a bitch outta Adam; Genesis 2:21
You gotta look at me when I'm killing you

To go viral you’d change you’re gender like Caitlyn Jenner you have no shame what so ever
We've outgrown you
Adams bitchmade from the rib cage we want the old you
Do this pussy so bad if you were TI’s kid he’d disown you
He's like "I'm American as shit, Honest Abe mixed with John McCain"
Well I battle rap his shit
I’m bodybag mixed with Shotty/Swave, the near divorce Caustic made
Tom Cruise mom's shoes we don’t walk the same
I’m a Lush intro with his nostrils glazed
I'm the energy of Dizaster but not the braids
I'm Three Of Them Thangs off the brain
I’m Pat Stay when he got the chain
I’m the apology you forgot to make to Cadalack Ron when you dropped his name
I’m PH in his Team Homi ways
I’ve every Bender multi schemed on a stage
I’m King Of The Dot in their beat boxing days
Mixed with the six people that lost their life getting crushed by T-Top on stage
And in this battle he started off with, "Battling for a decade, you're truly a disgrace
If I'm battling in 2021 someone shoot me in the face."
You've used battle rap since day one, this is where we both got our fame from
If I'm battling in 2029, pat me on the back like, "thanks for remembering where you came from."
You got nice flow but no punching skill
Ten years I’m punching still
The Philly Prince Will get sonned in Cali I’m Uncle Phil
Slashed throat
They put his face on a shirt, "RIP the Frat GOAT"
This time when you go viral on a tee (T) it ain’t for fat jokes
You handpick opportunities it’s see through
'Ganik didn’t even say your name and I knew it’d be you
I just said I think I’ll win and he wrote "#metoo"
"I'm your executioner, Lucifer" shut the fuck up
Your time is fading
Rone, who you annihilating?
You look like all five people that died from vaping
You callin' out Mike P? Dawg that's light
Bring him to the SMACK Killer we are not alike
I’ll treat him like the show you got fired from and Drop The Mic(Mike)
I got a violent left; ANTIFA
You getting floored this time, fuck a metaphor or rhyme
The right will have him higher than our credit scores combined
While you were doing keg stands grabbin' your friends erection
I beat you in a freestyle battle with less aggression
Listen Rone this ain’t beer pong you won’t get redemption
The frat killer, tell Brad, Thad and Chad that this verse is amazing
You can’t fuck with the GOAT this ain’t fraternity hazing
How many IPA's have you tried today?
Your parents got the job done
My sweet 16: Not fun
What you know 'bout asking your dad for two Mercedes and you got one?
This ain’t for the news fans that just want us to hold lead
Code red
Connor Mcgregor this for the old heads
Rone you ain’t nothing but a fuckin' cokehead
Waitin' for someone to have a bump for him like an old thread
I got all kinds of tablets I can supply this addict
So much speed Al Davis tried to draft it
Have him snortin' 'til he feel ill
Coke so white Method Man assumed it voted for Real Deal
He gon' make this Barstool vs Wild N' Out and that's a fact
I mean I don't care and you claimin' I don't clap a gat
Bring up Timothy De La Ghetto cause he's got the man purse, that just means my man is strapped
Who from Barstool is here to support you?
I mean, well that guy's wack
Your friends aren't in your corner and that's a fact
No matter how much you ignore this, you will always be welcomed in battle rap
One day you'll be fired from your job and that's a fact
Don't be surprised cause a Barstool never has your back
Time!

[Round 2: Rone]
Imagine being a grown man, Charron fan
You talk about Bodied like it's Rocky, the delusion is astounding
It's budget was $15,000,000 and it grossed $100,000
And you had what? Two more lines than me?
Shit ain't never been funny
Congratulations, you had a bigger part in losing Eminem's money
But while we were shooting Bodied you were drinkin' in the lobby
In the Standard in Los Angeles, you were gettin' sloppy
You started mouthing off to Pat Stay I thought, "This won't go well."
And sure enough, he bitch slapped you in front of the whole hotel
And I don't wanna misconstrue it, you got slapped and your lip was drooling
You would've thought that he dropped this fruit from the way that this bitch was bruising
That's why we laugh when you talk tough like, "Who does he think he's fooling?"
You almost died off that smack in an L.A. hotel we would've thought it was Whitney Houston
You were a terrible drunk and he smacked you in the Standard
So K-Shine's not an outlier, smacking you is the standard
I mean Aye Verb stepped to you, Shotgun peppered you
Bonnie almost broke her fuckin' wrist dick checkin' you
Shine made a mess of you, Pat disrespected you
Ars' had his hands on your face like he was blessin' you
So who the fuck are you playin' with?
You've already been 86'd
I don't mean they cancelled you, I mean number of hands on you if they dusted your face for prints
Why does that always happen to you?
Why does that never happen to me?
It's not happenstance that they slot you fam', that's just who you happen to be
But you embrace the school shooter image like you think that shit is powerful
'Til I lift you up and beat the fucking warning signs outta you
Bro this one's a camcorder, it'll help deliver the picture
This one's a transformer it'll turn him into a sprinter
Your dad's a mechanic from Orleans, well I had to have a talk with him
It's funny he works at Midas, and you got a touch of Autism
But you take pride in Wild N' Out when it's legitimately terrible
15 straight years of the same Mariah Carey joke
Word to Nick Cannon's turban, I've been offered Wild N' Out six times, there's written record of that
Six times, ain't that the amount of seasons that you've been in the cast?
Bro, from Wild N' Out to Drop The Mic to battles in this league
They'll only ever call you when they can't book me
The name brand versus the budget version
Undeserving, less funny person
The first choice that they cater too versus the back up, the safety school
The option is less sexy when they can't sign Gretzky
The Chrysler 300 they rent when they can't afford the Bentley
Bro, all of Viacom loves me, they would kill to write a check
They'd have a pilot waitin' on me like a fuckin' private jet
Yo, you sound like you're high on helium, the show is the height of tedium
This skinny little geek is tryin' to make it on TV, that's a dying medium
But before I retire his ass like Andrew Luck
Let's talk about that time Organik watched some groupie bitch and you fuck
You went soft but tried to keep going cause the audience had you rattled
Isn't it bad enough he had to watch you pretend to be hard in your battles?
Bro, you love to go on SMACK to brag on the fake crack you slang
And gats you bang
If it were up to you, you'd be on a Banned (band) every month like Andrew Yang
But what about that time you said, "Mexicans can't be super heroes" cause quote "They're too lazy bro"
But what's really lazy though?
The accent? The basic quotes
The fact that you were hitting a Dominican with racist tropes that aren't even creative jokes?
I mean, Corey Charron, hates the Mexicans more than the Border Patrol
He's not callin' shots, he's callin' cops to a foreigner's home
He'll cock his gun he hears someone say "señor" on the phone
Well the coroner's home, put four in his dome
Get beat to death, leave the flesh around your cornea swole
This an orchestra, what you pen is boring and slow
Past your expiration date, baby wait your formula's old
You go the wrong way at every single fork in the road
I'll leave your body stretched out like the warrior pose
Out of all of battle rap, I got the corniest clone
You hate Mexicans? Then get the fuck out California bro!
Bro, I'm a mix of Rambo and Tony Soprano
I'll tag your man's toe like I was Virgil Abloh
You're off white thinking you got the best answer
Unless there's something you want to get off your chest after like breast cancer
Cause at the negotiating table, you're softer than Ned Flanders
You're not scoring, Travi$ Scott's Jordan's your check's backwards
Bro you said- I got a million ways kill him, but if none of all that work
I'll just drop him off in east Oakland in his confederate flag shirt
Bro you could never match my moves in or out the ring
Call me Roney Bae The Prince but to you I'll always be the king

[Round 3: Charron]
He callin' me racist but...
They say "Head ICE robbed you", your third round was light
"If you couldn't make it out of Harlem how did my dad make it out of Harlem?"
Because he’s white
Like, was that a third round or a Third Reich?
I’m no B. Dot, I'm not an expert on this situation
And this coming from someone that accused B.E.T. of discrimination
But between your dad and Head ICE, who struggled in life more?
You said, "It’s not your fault if your born poor but it is if you die poor."
That’s what your physicist dad taught you while he set up your trust fund?
Due to his skin, which Harlem cops did he run from?
Which neighborhoods, which schools was he shunned from?
That mentality is the same reason that Trump won
You said, my dad was racist about the Mexicans, but c'mon son
It’s not your fault if you're born to a racist but it is if you become one
Also, against Head ICE you also said, "You’re tethered to an existence that doesn’t mean shit to me
While I was taking trips to Sicily
You were in self imposed poverty figuring out what kid to feed"
Cringe
The epitome
You act black, now look inwardly (N-wordly)
Predatory lending, they couldn't get help yet
They were designated to hoods they couldn't get out yet
This motherfucker thought "redlining" was a Microsoft spell check
Only people on 4chan like how you rap
Your favorite chore is laundry day, so you can separate the whites from the blacks
You spit those bars in Toronto in front of a bunch of crackers
I dare you to come to Cali and say All Lives fucking Matter
You know how many Trump supporters are here? One: Dizaster
Aye, I did wear the confederate flag sleeve I accept all the scrutiny
I acted foolishly
Apologize- I didn't know the history and apologized to the community
We move as a unit
Why? Because of unity
Yesterday I was called out for appropriation, today you won't hear an "Ooops" from me
This ain’t even a battle, this is a eulogy
That’s why shhh Rone, cause when I look at you it’s a moment of silence for who I used to be
You brag about your vaca's like "Look at my big trips."
You make 100K, you think MTV is how I get rich?
Air B&B, HVAC that’s the right business
You get Bud Light I sip Cris'
Knock over his Barstool, you ain't Wild N' Out like this bitch
Last year 700K those are my digits
You’d have to save up 7 years pay to get my interest
Two apps, get paid when the site gets hits
I inspire kids with Autism plus my girl has nice big tits
Listen Rone I ain’t the one to talk that "I’m winning at life" shit with
You tried to stunt on Head ICE, dawg relax
Bring up my Autism I have retarded stacks
If I wake up feeling like a million bucks the market crashed
A millionaire at 25 how can the prince be proud?
After this quick beat down
You can battle my pockets and spit your Big T rounds
I don’t watch Barstool I put that on the Bible
I’d rather swallow crack before my Morgan’s piano recital
Or watch another Chilla/Trevor rematch for the title
You got at The Saurus for gambling, you bet on sports games all the time
So I made my own odds on the ways that you’ll die
A trillion to one?
You died from your fans getting trampled in the streets
1,000 to 1?
You OD'd after your motherfuckin' panics increased
10 to 1? You'll develop AIDS from Sandusky's beef
Or 1 to 1: You die of shame after admitting you got raped once this battle's released
This is karma for all your rounds
I mean, you’re not Big T fat, but you put on some pounds
You quit battling for a podcast you’re basically Okwerdz now
You only hit up Ganik when he's got something to offer you
You look like a bird and flock like a vulture
Your dad's a physicist and he need you "Adam" (atom) cause you make up everything that’s wrong with this culture
So fuck your mother, fuck your brother I hope your step mom dies
Fuck every Ben Shapiro speech on your desktop drive
Fuck Barstools segments on "The Best Pop Flies"
You make podcasts for white kids that drop the N bomb on X-Box Live
Fuck you for not knowing what your privilege does
Fuck the Barstool founder for calling all women "Sluts"
Fuck you for laughing at it with your buds
Fuck you for promoting a rape culture that you’re a victim of
Fuck Joseph Kahn for giving you a pity role and 100’s of bucks
After you got rejected for the role of Adam cause you weren’t funny enough
Fuck your character in Bodied you wouldn’t engage to a thing
How can you propose? For two years you stayed away from the ring
Fuck your for not leading as an example
Fuck you for not giving a shot to those trapped in your shadow
You're from Philly, so fuck you for the last two Cassidy battles
Fuck you for thinking King Of The Dot isn't the place for you
Fuck you for only showing up to a SMACK event, look what you made me do
And fuck the URL for last night when they hacked our PPV!
I mean, people wanna go against Rone but watch how I rhyme first
He wants to do this he's diggin' up dirt
Well watch how he goes in his guy's hearse
He says I hate Spanish people, I mean is that how your mind works?
He also said Organik watched me fuck a bitch, I'll show him how the dime hurts
You're right, he was watching while I had a tag team with Myverse
You’re an ungrateful hypocrite the truth's gotta sting
I am more successful then you and I’m still doing my thing
So Trevor, it’s time for me to see you in the ring
It’s Charoney baby the prince and soon to be king
Let's get it

[Round 3: Rone]
Bro, I always knew he had a side hustle, poppin' fly shit in The Bay
I always assumed he worked for Uber 'cause he always drives women away
But you love to talk about this money and never tell us where you got it
Turns out you were a door-to-door energy salesman who just ran old people's pockets
You were scamming their life away and then treating it like a game
And because of your lying ways, they were broke in their dying days
Well, try that shit with my grandma, find out if she's really with the shit
She'd be off the porch like Clint Eastwood, we'd see Billy pistol whipped
Bro, being part of a pyramid scheme makes you a sucker regardless
But scamming old people? I give a fuck if you're autistic, that shit is retarded
Bro, scamming the senile, old folks losing their memory
The irony, you taking advantage of people who aren't all there mentally
Well, I bet you wish you were back selling gas facing the elderly instead of me
'Cause I'll give you the option that you didn't, let's see if you keep that same energy
Yo, I'll get your girlfriend dog, when she comes through the East Bay
And I'll pay Michael Vick to abuse it each day
I'll bring it right up in her room, if she refuse the BJ
I'll beat it right in front of her like Louis C.K
See, it could get real eventful if I use the steel against you
You catch six from the tre (tray), that's a Philly special
I'll Philly Pretzel Billy Pistolz, he'll be lookin' like Whoopi's braids
But if I really pistol Billy Pistolz, he'll be lookin' like Billy Mays
So you're saying that autism shit's real, though? Ooh, that's mean
Bet you wish you listened to Hollow and skipped the flu vaccine
But I love my people with autism unconditionally, best believe it
But for you to bring it up in a title match for sympathy and expect other people not to talk about it, almost seems like you're askin' for special treatment
See, I'm here to dig a hole for you, soul-remove and lower you
And just cause you have autism don't mean I'll take it slow for you
I'll whip your ass like anyone else, 'cause that's what I'm supposed to do
But it's a shame you don't understand social cues, 'cause you have no idea how bad I'm owning you
I've read up on non-verbal learning disorder as some insight on your brain for me
It said you can read a Civil War book, remember every general's name, but not realize it's about slavery
And that explained to me why your concepts can't hit and each angle's a bad miss
Because other than generally (General Lee), you really don't understand shit
I kept reading, and I almost felt bad for the geek
But the deeper I got, what did I happen to see?
It helps you focus on a task, you are the man with your frees
It helps you access rhymes, you are fast on your feet
You're less likely to be insulted, that helps you battle with ease
It compartmentalizes thoughts, all your facts and your schemes
So by the time I finished reading, I was mad as can be
Until I realized the one that's really disadvantaged...is me
I mean, do you know how hard it is to be a battle rapper without autism?
Who's done a drug, a beer, who's really got bitches?
I started schemin', vaccine-in', you don't know how bad I want the shit
The more I'm reading, I can't believe it, it's like everybody's got the shit
Fucking Steve Jobs, Dickinson, Einstein, Newton, Bill Gates, Burton, Mozart, Darwin
And wouldn't it be crazy if someone like Jobs went on stage with a sob story instead of making the iPod?
If Einstein was "woe is me" instead of finding relativity
If Newton never understood his own gift's gravity?
If Mozart never played strings and curled up in a ball
If Darwin had played the victim and had never evolved
See, that's my problem with your scamming shit, it isn't moralism
It doesn't matter how rich you are if you're still making poor decisions
You're a scumbag from your actions, no one's exploiting you
Being autistic doesn't make you any less of a man, dawg, but your choices do
See, I'm up front, you're sidewinding, I'm a lone wolf, you're hive-minded
I'm obsessed with originality, you're the most derivative on the battle scene
You have the charm of Rush Limbaugh, women love me, you make their skin crawl
I'm good at everything, you find your second talent, then show me
You're a punk bitch, fuck stick, one trick pony
And those that pay attention are never gon' respect him
It has nothing to do with autism, we're just on different ends of the spectrum
And he could never match my moves either in or out the ring
They call me Roney Bae The Prince, but to you, I'll always be the king!Embed

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Your love for me came as a waterfall
Flowin' inside me like never before
Your love for me, somethin' I didn't see
But baby, I know better now
When you walked in the room that very night
A special feelin' just burst inside
There was only you, nobody else
But baby, I know better now

[Chorus]
Don't wanna love you if you don't love me
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I (If I) didn't tell you this tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
And now you're back inside my house again
I'm tryin' deeper to explain
'Cause baby, I wanna get it on
And baby, you're the one for me
But now that I have got you all alone
After all this talkin' on the phone
I should be strong, there's nothing wrong
I'll tell you this is where you belong, where you belong

There You Go by P!nk

17 ContributorsThere You Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
Please don't come around talkin' 'bout that you love me
'Ccause that love just is not for me
And I don't wanna hear that you adore me
And I know that all you're doing is running your mind games
Don't you know my game beats these games?
So your best bet is to be straight with me

[Pre-Chorus]
So you say you wanna talk, let's talk
If you won't talk, I'll walk
Yeah, it's like that
I got a new man, he's waiting out back
Now what, whatcha think about that?
Now when I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically, I'm through with you
Whatcha wanna say, had to have it your way, had to play games
Now you're begging me to stay

[Chorus]
There you go, looking pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go
There you go because your lies got old
Look at you, there you go

[Pre-Chorus]
So you say you wanna talk, I don't
Say you wanna change, I won't

Had to have it your way, had to play games, now you're begging me to stay

[Chorus]
There you go, looking pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go
There you go because your lies got old
Look at you, there you go
[Bridge]
Oh, don't you wish you could turn the hands of time
Don't you wish you still were mine?
Don't you wish I'd take you back?
Don't you wish that things were simple like that, oh?
Didn't miss a good thing 'til it's gone
But I knew it wouldn't be long, till you came running back
Missing my love, there you go

[Chorus]
There you go, looking pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go
There you go because your lies got old
Look at you, there you go
There you go, looking pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go

Ooh, girl, oh, girl
No more, no more
Bounce, baby, bounce, baby
You can move, uh
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Baby, relax, sit back and chill (Yeah)
Just give me a second and let me tell you how I feel
'Cause all around town you've been steppin' out
Runnin' your mouth about
What made you think I wouldn't find out?
Wasn't I there for you? Truly cared for you
Maybe my love was just too good
Could've had it good, now the love is gone
And went back to your hood with the 5411's on

[Pre-Chorus]
Does he lace you with the finer things? (Does he?)
Does he make you wanna scream his name?
Does he hit it from the front to back?
Did you let him break it down like that?
Should've told me the love was gone (Should've told me, baby)
Never thought that you'd do me wrong (Mmm)
Girl, I thought that your love was strong
'Til I saw you in another man's arms

I saw you on the ave' and I laughed
In the backseat, be spilling Henney in his lap
Thought it was me that you was all about
But I'm havin' doubts 'cause I see you tryna play me out
But when the brother called the crib with beef
Didn't I represent you when I caught him in the streets?
So let me get the keys to Lex and no more checks
And no more hangin' baguettes around your neck, babe

Wonderful by Everclear

"Hey, ain't life wonderful? Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful... Isn't it wonderful now?"

[Verse 1: Art]
I close my eyes when I get too sad
I think thoughts that I know are bad
Close my eyes and I count to ten
Hope it's over when I open them

I want the things that I had before
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
I wish I could count to ten
Make everything be wonderful again

[Verse 2: Art]
Hope my mom and I hope my dad
Will figure out why they get so mad
Hear them scream, I hear them fight
They say bad words that make me wanna cry

Close my eyes when I go to bed
And I dream of angels who make me smile
I feel better when I hear them say
Everything will be wonderful someday

[Pre-Chorus: Art]
Promises mean everything when you're little
And the world's so big
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes

Don't make me leave here with my foot in yo' ass; be cool

Nastier than a full grown German Shepherd; motherfucker keep stepping
They don't fuck with me and they don't
Y'all bitches can't catch me and you won't
Pay ya fare, fix your hair, throw that pussy
Got a Prada for bonapalies, and Donna for my babooski
You think I'm tricking? Bitch, I ain't trippin
I'm buyin if you got nice curves for your iceberg
Drinkin Henn and acting like it do something to me
Hope this indecent proposal make you do somethin with me
Fuck a dollar girl, pick up fifty
And fuck that coward, girl, you need a real nigga

I Wish by Carl Thomas

16 ContributorsI Wish Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all
Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she
Was unhappily married with children

[Chorus]
And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love for me
But she still belongs to someone else

[Verse 2]
It hurts so bad, for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me
She chose to stay, at home
So they could be a family
For the children
But what about me?

[Chorus]
And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love for me
But she still belongs to someone else
You might also like[Bridge]
Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22
Either way it went
Someone had to lose

And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love for me
But she still belongs to someone else
And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love for me
But she still belongs to someone else

Oh I wouldn't feel this pain

Now I don't have to question
Where you were last night
'Cause I already know what you will say

But I can't be mad at ya
'Cause there's something that you don't know
Then when you're gone I do my own thing
And I catch a bone while you're doggin' me

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine
When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine

When I tried to get your attention
You ignored me every time
You were so caught up doin' your dirt that

You may not believe it, but it's real, the game is so real (So real)
So real, so real
Oh, don't think we won't know it
When you're out in the club

[Chorus]
When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine
When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine
[Chorus]
When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine (-I-I-I)
When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine2Embed
