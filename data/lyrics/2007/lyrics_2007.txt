Bleeding Love by Leona Lewis

63 ContributorsBleeding Love Lyrics[Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1]
Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh
But somethin' happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true
And everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' I'm going crazy
Ooh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Mm, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tryin' hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercin' sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from fallin', ooh, yeah
But nothin's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open, mmh
[Bridge]
And it's drainin' all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearin' these scars for everyone to see

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
Ooh, you cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love (You)
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love (You)

Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like "You're—"

No time to waste, back to my place"
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say

In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

La, da, da, da

[Verse 1]
The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
Be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

[Chorus]
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

[Verse 2]

I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown, full grown
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending, do they?

Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty, yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen, close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

Hey there, Delilah, I know times are gettin' hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar, we'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away, I'd write it all
Even more in love with me, you'd fall
We'd have it all

But they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never, ever be the same
And you're to blame

[Verse 3]
Hey there, Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to

They're gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work, they're gonna give you a smirk
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine

[Chorus]
They said, "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

The boys and girls in the clique, the awful names that they stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
But if you're troubled and hurt, what you got under your shirt
Will make them pay for the things that they did

La, la, la la (Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to Heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la la (Ayy!)

But homie, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then
Aight, man, holla, then

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a–uh–depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
With way less effort
'Cause when you try hard, that's when you die hard
Your homies looking like, "Why, God?"
When they reminisce over you, my God

Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say, "Sit down, it's just a talk"
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you

Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside?
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside?

Bleed It Out by Linkin Park

Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fuckin' mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rollin' in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignorin' him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

Hey girl, you know you drive me crazy
One look puts the rhythm in my hand
Still, I'll never understand why you hang around
I see what's going down
Cover up with makeup in the mirror
Tell yourself, "It's never gonna happen again"
You cry alone, and then
He swears he loves you

[Chorus]
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now, as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found

[Verse 2]
A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
Every action in this world'll bear a consequence
If you wade around forever, you will surely drown
I see what's going down

Say you're right again, heed my lecture

Who's to know if your soul will fade at all?
The one you sold to fool the world
You lost your self esteem along the way, yeah

Paralyzer by Finger Eleven

35 ContributorsParalyzer Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hold on so nervously to me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good, it's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should
This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

[Verse 2]
I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me

Things between us gon' get better
Men steady comin' after you
Women steady comin' after me
Seems like everybody wanna go for self
And don't wanna respect boundaries
Tellin' you all those lies
Just to get on yo' side

Just know that I try to always apologize
But I'ma have you first, always in my heart to keep you satisfied

Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, ho sale

Baby say, "I don't talk Dogg, then she told on me", oh well
Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do?
Baby, stick to me, and I'ma stick on you
If you pick me, then I'ma pick on you

Rip ridin' the poles and them doors is tight

See you lookin' at me, now what it's gon' be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' 'bout thirty stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move amphetamines
Girl I, spend money like it don't mean nothing
And besides, I got a thing for you

[Chorus: Akon]

I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know

Mobbin' through the club and I'm low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker's section (Just smokin', just smokin')
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby, I see you)
Hmm, it's cool, we jet, the mood is set
Your p— is wet, you're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck (Yeah)
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin' (Yeah)
Your t— is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me
[Verse 4: Akon]
Girl, and while you're lookin' at me, I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everything and that's kinda scary
'Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin' got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you), you already know

Fluorescent Adolescent by Arctic Monkeys

120 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsEnglishFrançaisDeutschFluorescent Adolescent Lyrics[Verse 1]
You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

[Chorus]
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, aren't as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

[Verse 2]
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Hey, yeah, huh
That's how much I love you (Yeah; No, whoa, whoa, huh)
That's how much I need you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Rihanna & Ne-Yo, Both]
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile (Uh)
Can I not like you for a while? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl, and then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden, I forget (That I was upset)
I can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

[Chorus: Rihanna & Ne-Yo]
And I hate how much I love you, boy (Yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)

Ridin' in the drop top with the top down
Saw you switchin' lanes, girl
Pull up to the red light, lookin' right
Come here, let me get your name, girl
Tell me where you from, what you do, what you like
Let me pick your brain, girl
And tell me how they got that pretty little face
On that pretty little frame, girl
But let me show you 'round, let me take you out
Bet you we could have some fun, girl
'Cause we can do it fast, fast, slow

I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd need you there when I cried
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie is made up on your side

[Pre-Chorus]
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

[Chorus]
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin' too
When you're gone, the words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you

Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?

New Shoes by Paolo Nutini

22 ContributorsNew Shoes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Woke up cold one Tuesday
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life
So I quickly opened the wardrobe
Pulled out some jeans and a t-shirt that seemed clean
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes that were ripped around the seams
And I thought these shoes just don't suit me

[Chorus]
Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh, short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

[Verse 2]
Woke up late one Thursday
And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
And I felt like there were two days missing as I focused on the time
Then I made my way to the kitchen
But I had to stop from the shock of what I found
The room full of all o' my friends all dancing round and round
And I thought: Hello, new shoes, bye-bye blues

Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking 'til the break of dawn

Set sail from sense, bring all her young
Set sail from where we once begun
While we wait, while we wait

[Pre-Chorus]
A hall of records, or numbers, or spaces still undone
Ruins, or relics, disciples, and the young
A hall of records, or numbers, or spaces still undone
Ruins, or relics, disciples, and the young

Light touch my hands, in a dream of Golden Skans, from now on
You can forget our future plans
Night touch my hands with the turning Golden Skans
From the night to the light, all plans are golden in your hands

But it ain't even gotta be like dat (Eh-heh-heh-heh-heh)
Yo' man, he be callin' me back
He say I'm fine and a matter of fact (Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh)
He ask how I do that, that fit my jeans over Baby Phat
Listen, I don't know the type of tricks he playin'
But I should warn you, I don't want yo' man (C'mon)

[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole & Missy Elliott]
I understand why you wanna try
To make him stay home late at night
But if he wanna go, he'll be gone, no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinkin' about mine and where he might be
(Baby, I don't wanna know)
Remember when I gave everything I got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How you love someone who didn't love me? (C'mon)

Kick 'em all straight to the curb like Beckham
Broke wit my ex, he with her for now
But little do she know, she's just a rebound (Hey!)
Callin my phone, she's so outta pocket
I been there before ol' girl, you need to stop it
Trickin on me when he tell you he ain't got it
You don't get the picture? My picture's in his wallet (WOO!)
Never ever thought I would leave him alone
But I let a dog roam, now he wanna come home
But I, don't trust him, though I still love him
No longer want him, lookin at his cousin
Kinda buzzin, loose off the Goose
Got him on the chase like cranberry juice
When he's with you, he's wishin it was me (Me)
You might be where he's at, but I'm where he wanna be, baby
Bay-bay
[Bridge: Keyshia Cole]
Love you! Hey! Let it go!

If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go

Then let it go (He ain't comin' home)
If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should

Pull up your pants (Just like em')
Take out the trash (Just like em')
Getting ya cash like 'em, fast like 'em
Girl, you outta act like ya dig (What I'm talkin' bout')
Security codes on everything
On vibrate so your phone don't ever ring (Joint account)
And another one he don't know about

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that
Tell you I love you, but when you call, I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me?
Like where you be at?
'Cause I'm out four in the morning
On the corner, rolling, doing my own thing, oh

[Chorus]
What if I
Had a thing on the side?
Made ya cry?
Would the rules change up
Or would they still apply?

Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Go run the streets (Just like 'em)
Come home and sleep like em'
Creep like em'

Keep a straight face when ya tell a lie
Always keep an air-tight alibi (Keep him in the dark)

Tears Dry On Their Own by Amy Winehouse

55 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisTears Dry on Their Own Lyrics[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Verse 1]
All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right, when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 2]
I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)

Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 3]
I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, my blue shade
My tears dry on their own
Woah, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry on their own, woah

Brianstorm by Arctic Monkeys

62 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsFrançaisBrianstorm Lyrics[Verse 1]
Brian, top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder, are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator

[Verse 2]
Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get, 'cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet, but she's yours
She'll be saying, "Use me, show me the jacuzzi"
I imagine that it's there on a plate, your whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened to make 'em wait for a while

[Bridge]
I doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire, you are the unforecasted storm

[Verse 3]
(Brian) Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying) You leave the other story standing
With your renditions and jokes, bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their thunder
Are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovatorSee Arctic Monkeys LiveGet tickets as low as $32You might also like54Embed

Come enjoy the life
Baby, take a ride
I just wanna vibe with you, you

And I've been kinda lonely
But I'm looking for somebody to talk to
Love me, someone who can hold me, is that you?

I'm looking for somebody I can call boo
Looking for the only one that I can give my all to
Tell me if it's you, you, you
What you wanna do, do, do?

You can give me extra credit, baby, I'll do more work
What you wanna do, do, do?
Now it's me and you, you, you

Paper bags and plastic hearts
All our belongings in shopping carts
It's goodbye
But we got one more night
Let's get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right

[Chorus]
Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight

[Verse 2]
Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side, but we'll cry
We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young
And we'll feel so alive

Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight

[Bridge]
All of the wasted time
The hours that were left behind me
Answers that we'll never find
They don't mean a thing tonight

[Chorus]
Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say

Better Than Me by Hinder

14 ContributorsBetter Than Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think you can do much better than me
After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I told myself I won’t miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

[Chorus]
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

[Verse 2]
While lookin’ through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were lookin’ for
If there’s one memory I don’t wanna lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room

Let it never be said
The romance is dead
Cause there's so little else
Occupying my head
There is nothing I need
Except the function to breathe
But I'm not really fussed
Doesn't matter to me

[Chorus]
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing, to me?

[Verse 2]
Due to lack of interest
Tomorrow is cancelled
Let the clocks be reset
And the pendulums held
'Cause there's nothing at all
Except the space in-between
Finding out what you're called
And repeating your name

Grace Kelly by MIKA

65 ContributorsGrace Kelly Lyrics[Intro]
"I wanna talk to you."
"The last time we talked, Mr. Smith, you reduced me to tears. I promise you it won't happen again."

[Verse 1]
Do I attract you?
Do I repulse you with my queasy smile?
Am I too dirty? Am I too flirty?
Do I like what you like?

I could be wholesome, I could be loathsome
I guess I'm a little bit shy
Why don't you like me, why don't you like me
Without making me try?

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to be like Grace Kelly, mm
But all her looks were too sad, ah
So I tried a little Freddie, mm
I've gone identity mad!

[Chorus 1]
I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me?
Why don't you walk out the door!

[Hook]
"Getting angry doesn't solve anything."

[Verse 2]
How can I help it, how can I help it
How can I help what you think?
Hello my baby, hello my baby
Putting my life on the brink

Why don't you like me, why don't you like me
Why don't you like yourself?
Should I bend over? Should I look older
Just to be put on your shelf?

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to be like Grace Kelly, mm
But all her looks were too sad, ah
So I tried a little Freddie, mm
I've gone identity mad!

[Chorus 2]
I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door!

[Bridge]
Say what you want to satisfy yourself
But you only want what everybody else says you should want...
You want

[Chorus 2]
I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like

Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door!

[Chorus 2]
I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like

I Tried by Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Akon

32 ContributorsI Tried Lyrics[Intro: Wish Bone]
Bone Thugs, Akon, yeah
You know, don't nothin' come easy
You gotta try real, real hard
I've tried hard
But I guess I gotta try harder

[Chorus: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
First let me explain that I'm just a black man
And I come from the dark side
So I'm havin' a hard time stayin' on track, man
My mind be racin' and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
So I'm startin' to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back, prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really I'm wrong
Then again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane chasin' my dreams
And then it seem when the fame and cash came
They just got me goin' crazy-y-y, lately
I've been so faded tryin' to erase it
But I just can't ‘cause the drama just grows greater
And I've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off 'til later

I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
It's like I'm takin' five steps forward and ten steps back
Tryin' to get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin' away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close?
And uh, I just don't know but I be out here fightin' demons
And it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland
And Lord, would you help me?
And stop this pain I keep inflictin' on my family?
Hustlin' and gamblin', trickin' and scramblin'
And losin' sight of what I'm supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage ‘cause everyday's a challenge
And man, I'm slippin', can't lose my balance, I'm tryin' not to panic
[Chorus: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
I see that things won't change
I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out it keeps pullin' me back, mane
Got me doin' dirty dirt
So used to this hustlin' money
That I don't understand no 9-to-5 work
Studied on the streets, hustlas know what I mean
Hustlas ballin' before us
I'm tryin' to make it to that major league
So we will never leave until the sun came up
Gotta get it—no, nope, not leavin' no budge
Today games they play
Gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you
Gotta watch what you sign to
Try so hard but I won't pull through
[Chorus: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up

Wait for You by Elliott Yamin

10 ContributorsWait for You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never felt nothing in the world like this before
Now I'm missing you, and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Oh, why did you have to go? You could have let me know
So now, I'm all alone
Girl, you could have stayed, but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around, it's a little bit more than I can stand
Oh, and all my tears, they keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

[Chorus]
So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you

Girl, I told you what it is, and it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me? You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby, why can't we just, just start over again
Get it back to the way it was?
If you give me a chance, I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 1]
This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply

[Verse 2]
This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme what you got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 3]
This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say "Yeah, I paid a guap"
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em "All aboard"
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (Woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (Ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply "Nobody got to die"
Similar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)

Now all I can do is hurt
When you left you took my heart
Got a confession to make...

I realised I meant nothing to you
I guess you thought I was your fool

Got a confession to make...

Don’t need to work hard that’s the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

[Verse 1]
Six months later now we’re big dog status
Name elevated but I still act average
Rockin’ shows in Dallas, ball like I play for the Mavericks
West Bank rapper and I’m one of the baddest
French Riviera spot and I’m getting in shape man
I think I’m Super M-a-n without a cape man
Ridin’ all day hustlin’, all for the cake man
I’m a Benjamin stack one inch taller than Great Danes
First they made cheap Ray-Ban like a felon
I’m growin’ up now spittin’ hotter than Mohellans
I’m a steal every girl ever gon’ to fly
I’m a young little dude, stay runnin’ from cops
And Marrero is the place where I got my props
People love me in da hood they don’t want me to stop
So uhh, that’s the only way I know how to rock
And I’m a stay rappers like won’t stop ‘til I drop

And they don’t question what I say cause I’m a ladies pimp
See this little one right here this fellow got stripes
And I is represent, my rail room for life

Wake up, blood-shot eye
Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

[Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

[Verse 2]
God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth

[Intro]
Hey! Uh
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky and I like it
Listen

[Verse 1]
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight
And she looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
Ooh, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight
Hey!

[Chorus]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh

She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
Well, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
Hey!

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare

54 ContributorsSweetest Girl (Dollar Bill) Lyrics[Intro: Wyclef Jean, Lil Wayne]
Some live for the bill, some kill for the bill (Yeah)
She whined for the bill, grind for the bill (Whoa)
And she used to be the sweetest girl
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill (Yeah)
And she used to be the sweetest girl
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill (Whoa)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean & Lil' Wayne]
High school, she was that girl
That make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
High school she was that girl
That make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She balls, he calls (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed
Go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in the wrong car
Bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She balls, he calls (where my money at?)

[Verse 2: Akon]
Pimpin' got harder 'cause hoes got smarter
On the strip is somethin' they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club, shakin' for a dub
Get triple times the money and spendin' it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the 9
See, everyday they feel the struggle but stayin' on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow, you gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know whether or not to lay low
'Cause 25 to life's no joke
To all my real guerillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women's gettin' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry
[Hook: Akon]

Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
It drives the world crazy
Weezy, she used to be…
And she used to be the sweetest girl!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Whatever, now she like sour amaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she ask him: "Where my money at?"
[Hook: Akon]
See, I'ma tell you like Wu told me

Oooooh, Damn!
I mean I just keep thinkin about you (awww baby)
I mean I wanna move on but I can't move on (oh, oh, oh, ooooh)
It's like you got some kind of hold on me
And I don't know
But I'm a go ahead and talk about it
Listen

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I'm sitting looking out the window like damn
Trying to fix this situation that's at hand
You still running through my mind - when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be
Me all on ya mind, I'm knowing that it couldn't be
Cause you ain't called, and I ain't even appalled
I still got a lot of pain, I ain't dealt with it all
I been running 'round with other chicks - I'm single and they loving it
I'm liking it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it - I'm trying to let you go
I can't get a grip of it, is what I'm trying to let you know
You gotta hold of some kinda control on me
I don't know what it is - but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm working at it and it ain't getting no better
Just trying to be like "yeah, forget it, whatever"
Instead of staring out this glass - looking at this bad weather
Damn I gotta pull myself together, cause...

You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
I'm too attached my heart want let me fall back
I got it bad that's what you can call that (ah)
And when I see you in the streets that's the worse for me
Use to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doing?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas telling me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm trying man I just don't know how
I be in all the top spots - leaving with the hot shots
Knowing they just want me cause I'm the top spot
That's not popping, and my brain ain't stopping
Thinking who she with? Or where she going? Is she club hopping?
I never had this kinda problem in my life
This is my first time dealing with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and every time you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right....cause
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Hook: Bow Wow]
Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been running through my mind all day - can you feel me
I been trying to get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been running through my mind all day  can you feel me
I been trying to get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did
But I guess I gotta move on right?
Still hard, and I still love you until this day... Peace13Embed

Pop, Lock & Drop It - Video Edit by Huey

52 Contributors30,000 Word Rap Song (World Record) Lyrics[Part I]

[Intro 1]
Please, this shit's so fuckin' hard
Helluva Beats
Yeah, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Thirty-thousand words in a rap
That's a first, and, in fact, that's the most in the world on a track
Yeah, I've been searchin' the map
For like any other person who could work it like that
Do it perfectly slow and then perfectly fast
I'm the only one that's out here, and I'm certain of that
Play me a beat, it gets turned into ash
If I play you a beat, it gets turned into trash
Ayy, hold up, wait
When I'm on the track, I make no mistakes
I can do the shit for like thirty-thousand hours
Fuck thirty-thousand words, I don't slow my breaks
I go UK, then I make so many pounds
Everybody think I'm overweight
Gettin' bread, see me eatin'
But I gotta go in, better hold my plate
Ooh, ooh, gotta switch up
I'm so godly, I'm the bishop
Now these haters wanna link up
My bars make them get the hiccups
So I had to run it up real quick
Freestyle, gotta do some real shit real quick
Everything I do is real big
'Cause I gotta get the crowd to feel this,  real lit, real shit
Nowadays, they write me and I don't write it back
See my future demons like a psychic and a psychopath
Swear I'm drivin' down the road and I might'a crashed
Do the dash, always movin', don't know where to find me at
Hey, movin' on, gotta find a team
Earnin' all my stripes like Camilla, but I'm lima beans
All these rappers 'bout to get fucked like they Riley Reid
I'm your teacher, so be quiet or I am assignin' seats
Pioneer to the shit, Leif Eriksson
I was even hunted, 2012, like I'm Jerry Lynn
All these places got me sneezin', need a Claritin
Until I fall off next year, I'ma be arrogant
Yeah, I'm runnin' all this shit, run it up
Yeah, you know that I be comin' up for a hun'ed bucks
At the start, all I wanted was like thirty-thousand hits
Got bored, add a couple zeroes for the shits
Why not? Look what I got, look what I bought
Camera is my true eye, I'm a side-clause
Shoes, they go too high, only high-tops
Fuck yeah, I'm the new guy, what am I on?
Come in, Jaden Smith, I'm a motherfuckin' icon
Boy, I'm too cold, I don't even have on my ice on
Too lit, I don't even have the mic on
And I'm too bright, I don't even have the lights on
Better wait up
Shit's too easy, like a layup
And my bitch too entertainin'
See the note, you gotta stay up
Takin' bets on that I'll fail
It's time to pay up
Now you tryna hide your face
I'm pretty sure that that ain't make-up, uh
I'm droppin' hits and gettin' world records
Who's your favorite artist, 'cause I'm sure better?
Well, maybe not, but I tried, though
Post Malone, I go psycho
Leave you a stink, like a rhino
'Cause I rap beef, no gyro
And I rhyme fast and I rhyme slow
Turned my L's into W's; typo
Uh, hop into the track
Give you the love and you give it right back
Ten different flows I be spittin', some trap
And some other shit get in it's get on the map
Done this for like a year, and now, my writing's clear
I've been gettin' respect, 'cause now I am here
And I'm here to stay, did you hear me say
"I'm not here to play"?
"He got a flow and a voice now
I remember when he chokin' a boy out
But he's back in, showin' no choice now
Don't you know that he's gonna destroy now?"
So I'm gonna get there, and I know how
Got these beats, I be blarin' 'em so loud
When we talk about bitches and money, this shit is so funny
My parents are so proud, damn
I'm startin' to try
Tryin' the shots at it, look at the ground and see stars in the sky
Drawin' the line
All of you rappers are dizzy, I can see the stars in your eyes
You're probably high
If you think that you compare to me, it must be part of the lines
Copyin' guys
You better send all those beats back to Future, like Marty McFly
Thirty-thousand words on a track, lil' bitch
Now these people turn my vid on and react, lil' bitch
Know I got the clout, I got the stats, lil' bitch
And you givin' me a headache, where's the Advil, bitch?
But I'm doin' all I can, and I did it in the past-tense
Makin' all this money up off of YouTube, off me AdSense
Money up off of YouTube, off AdSense
All of you are wack, that's a fact, I'ma rap then
And I rap, huh, I'm a laptop
Eminem holds the world record for "Rap God"
1.6K words
Though, we already have that topped
And we'll do it for another hour
And I'm underrated and I'm underpowered
My bars are so filthy, uh
All of y'all need to take another shower
For every fan, there's a hundred doubters
And they let me know up in the comments
But you know that we ain't done
'Cause I gotta talk my nonsense
And I gotta keep it clean, uh
Do exactly what my mom says
And I know when they headed for the top
And we still be makin' progress
I can spit bars for nine months
Then deliver you a new life
Yeah, we eatin' in this bitch, uh
All y'all better take a huge bite
And I didn't even write that shit
'Cause I freestyle, you still like that shit
See my video, press 'like' on it
That subscribe button? Better wipe that shit
I'm getting tired of this beat
I think it's time to change it
'Cause I'll spaz on trap
Old school boom-bap, you name it
Think of that as a intro
Now we get into the meat of it
This some shit you didn't see comin'
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you think of it!

[Intro 2]
Heh, ayy!
Ayy, ayy
Uh, switch up
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2]
Look out the window, see past it, but we're faintin' reflections
You never laugh like you used to, you've got fainter expressions
You headin' down the wrong path and they changin' directions
Maybe don't mention 'bout how I made me your blessin'
And lately, I question the shit that was taught to me
I'm awkwardly stoppin' these conversations
Hey, how long you waitin' till the day you wake up and thank God you made it?
I don't like to dwell, but man, I gotta say it, don't like my songs, but you still gotta play it
Don't like your road, just N.W.A., Dr. Dre it
Stop contemplatin' and stop complainin'
And recreate it, actually, don't recreate it, be creative
Reached the place where you still vibe in that shit when we replay it
Living a life of pain just to alleviate it
When you haven't used nothing but distractions to really take it
Yeah, maybe they'll change when they see we made it
We headin' onto new platforms and leavin' the basics
[Verse 3]
Uh, my creative process is making progress
Despite my background, I haven't gotten to playin' lacrosse yet
Don't you know we got a good thing goin'?
I've been watchin' all these shows while I could be showin'
I've been creeping up on the door, so dangerous
You looking at statistics, while I figure how I'm changin' them
I done learned so many things in my past life
Now I don't give a single shit about the rap life
That's nice, ain't it? That's nice to be given advice when I paint it
Have twice much the fame, and
I can't even comprehend that much in the future
Hatin' the teacher, but you loving the tutor
Enter the game, I'm a fuckin' intruder
Stealin' these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter
Procrastinatin' 'cause my fucking computer
No willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser

[Verse 4]
Sittin' alone at 3 AM
Chillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend
Man, this shit is too wild, I "must behave, Ben"
That's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when
I'm on the top of this drop and they're rocking the world with confidence
Accomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?
-Obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me
Luckily, I've been trained to test the system, don't you fuck with me
I hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it
I hope that one day, you'll see we made it
No, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain, I just alleviate it
I'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest
That is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'
I'm givin' dignity, cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'
I'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside
Guessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind
[Hook 1]
And I'm in time
-Workin' all my life, get that in line
I'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out
Nobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline
I'm on the incline, I'm on the incline
Stay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine
I'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline
Nobody can really understand how my shit climb

[Verse 5]
Have I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet
I'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead
I stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous
Who is this ten-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?
Why the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do
I don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, "Bye", to you
Hey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do
You have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue
You gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset
Set headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead
I guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed
Impressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said
But I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song
Do right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron
You try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes
Some straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline

[Interlude 1]
Water break
I got a lot to say
It's been eleven minutes so far
Actually, it hasn't, it's been shorter

[Verse 6]
How can
I have a believable meaning
When all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury
Nobody seen it or  greet it?
But what if it's different? I mean, it's all seeming to be
And it's in inconceivable dreaming
I know it's so unbelievable, being
Stuck in this rare unachievable feeling
They givin' me something, I ended up leaving
They givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'
No positive side, ended up seeing
What life could be like from a  different lead in
Thank God for a cover zone
So I know when and where to cross it
All over the place
I'm surprised I haven't lost it

[Hook 2]
Yeah, ayy, and I'm feeling like I'm at the top, uh
Livin' to the max now
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background
And the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down
Go till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out
After, I'll do the math now, it's garbage, take the trash out
But I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout

[Verse 7]
Okay, it's time to go fast
So sit back and relax, and just maybe you'll get it
About time, but maybe you're mad I said it
You gon' pay attention, cash or credit?
I have to let it go back a second
I have some lyrics in the past that I have to edit
Now we're back in the middle of the track and fed it
Mix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it
We moved on, walked past the exit
Want you to come back and pass a message
-Never pack bags and trash, you left it
Kinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it
Money, never am glad I spent it
If I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it
If you ever feel bad or sad, accept it
Think back to the track and the rap that Ben did
Yeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it
If this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus
I'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this
Voice is more powerful than a million instruments
Suddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else
People want me to grow because of you
But I'm never going to level my endeavors to be better
Than the people that never had trust in me
Yeah, uh

[Hook 3]
And I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah
Livin' to the max now, uh
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm stepping up, I never back down, more focused on background
And the music and how my rap sounds

[Verse 8]
Speak up, and they're messing with the track now
People are tellin' me that I'm fallin' short
Looking back at you when you're missing all the cash now
And I'm mad at the fact that
I'm not in my right mind
Meant to be a half-decent rapper
But I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time
Lookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find
Lookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime
I find so much life
I wonder why I can't just find mine
Got so many confusing questions
So much knowledge, I can't use the lessons
I'm emerging out with a new profession
I'ma do the best with my new perfection
And I'm doin' it
I'm moving onto this future shit
These hooligans are complete fools in that
They just don't understand that I am through with it
Improvin' it, I'm improvin' it
I got my brain, and I'm usin' it
And I'ma make it out alive when I'm playin' and takin'
And makin' this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits
You're clueless
Ninety percent of y'all ignorant
Keeping your minds oh-so limited
Get off your high horse, because it is time to figure it out
Seeming so close, I can picture it now
Success in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now
Envisioning deeper ambitions, and now
I'ma get to it, that is what living's about

[Interlude 2]
Uh, God!
Uh
My voice is gone already, shit
Alright, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 9]
Think I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches
Adolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us
Makin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die
Makin' you hang your head low, but say, "Reach for the skies"
Life is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies
I'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes
I feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry
With all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try
Yeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply
Tryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry
Fuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, "Why?"
So I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh
Like, oh well, I can say that I tried
Hopped into life and then I stayed for the ride
So many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside
And I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn
This reminds me of days when I drive in L.A.​
I'm screamin', "Hi" to the sky up with a smile on my face
Now I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace
All of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place
Swept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace
And now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet
I used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic
Recently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it
See my friends from kindergarten go to rehab
That's the type of shit that makes you think back
To simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds
Before reality could ground us, we would live in the skies
And as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)
Man, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist
I felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist
And now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit
You only look at what you got once you see that it's lost
And life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce
Don't understand rappers braggin', "I got that paper on me"
Man, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me
So what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?
To me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money
Rain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study
And write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn
Like Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize
These Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's
This is a natural high
I see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies
I wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried
They say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie
They think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid
As DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive
Threw out half of my album, it wasn't good enough
Shit, I mean it still isn't good enough
I'm like a active volcano, I know I could erupt
But I guess I am not full enough, damn
I swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel
Man, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal
Man, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real
Thirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel
Yeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement
Yeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent
Every day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest
And if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted
Most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me
So when I die, I know I left us with something to leave
So when I wake up in the morning with something to see
Yeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be

[Verse 10]
Benny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said
If you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous-
Many want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant
Got iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence
Yeah, I know I'm way too cocky
But I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out
So when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better
That's benefit of the doubt
I've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom
It's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often
And I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around
Always stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-
Yeah, this is freedom of speech
Tryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace
Sacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree
Opportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-
Nah, I'm just tryna find some clarity
Apparently, it all has to do with popularity
There will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to
What is carefully being prepared to me
Sometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity
I'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful in the very least

[Verse 11]
Giving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see
Everyone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy
'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case
Shot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass
Off of the place, brought in a way, predict what I will probably say
And at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so obviously, let the audience say
So let me explain this to those who came in, looking at the stages
Seeing a white kid thinking he's famous, when they don't understand
That I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest
Entertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in

[Verse 12]
-Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize
Start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try
That's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'
With the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon
But I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'
Limited ability with little humility
But whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me
I'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history
Tryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me
Tryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg
You beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me
Showin' up on your device, control/option/delete
Consider myself elite, measure myself in retweets
I be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me
Instead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout
I'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house
Tryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch
I'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out
Into reality, in normality actually happily
Found myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?
'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing
Nothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing
Not complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it
Love sleepin' and just usin' the internet
But my time is limited, and I better figure this
Before I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips
And let me just tell you what I have came to do
Tryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to
Tryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo
And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through
And if a major record label is looking at me
I'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats
I can rap fast, and rap slow
I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so
I'm like MJ back when he had the afro
Also, I'm not black, so... maybe not
But before everyone gets angry, stop
I'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block
All the people who keep on going crazy off
'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got
A lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker
With some dominant teachers
I deserve to be a starter, but constantly on the bleachers
I'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager
They be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it
To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid
So when you're nearin' this, please let me know
When I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go
Hear the metronome combined in the compilation
To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation
But that is just a dream, and probably a combination
Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in
But when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game
I was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name
But when you think about it, it is all insane
What can be created from chemicals in this brain
But when you look at me, you lackin' respect
When I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest
Has in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step
Until I'm on the same stage, and you have it again
But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame
You think about how people used to sit and call you names
And you check and wonder if it will be all the same
Step back into reality, it all remains, damn

[Interlude 3]
Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now
On my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit
Hold on, uh
Goddamn it

[Verse 13]
My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean
This is off the top, I don't need to use no machines
Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever
But I am very clever, okay, okay
I'm gonna take a drink, if you're watchin' this, take a drink too
These are some shit' that you can drink to
But drink water unless you're of age
You know what I'm sayin'? Ayy

[Interlude 4]
Okay, okay
Uh
Uh
Ayy

[Verse 14]
I feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous
-Most of humanity's made of idiots
I barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?
You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?
Please... what I do is barely poetry
There's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me
But still consider me confident
Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness
But honestly, all of this is haunting me, probably
It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling
Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'
It's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening
It's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake
I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away
Yeah, we're just tryna find that great escape
To get away from how we're living life day-to-day
Some people find it in a drink or in a cup
Or in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love
But all I know is that it's tough
And all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much

[Verse 15]
I'm young and ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?
These kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players
That shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low
Got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be lyin', but I came to show
What I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype
And I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life
-Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights
Ahead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night
-Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass
-Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast
Remember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it
And say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected
Take a deep breath, 'cause I need that
Most of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast
My bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors
You want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards
Say that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this
I'm singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit
Tryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day
'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?
I'm making the most of a crazier flow, so many ways it could go
I'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home, I'm willing to make it my own
I'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it, even if staying up late is the needed bit
Reason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it, leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch
Meaning, these people ain't feelin' rich, reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it
Pleasin' these liars, they've peaked, and so now they're recedin' agreein' to be a live without leading it
Flow's so dope, I think it's time that we take a break
We all make mistakes and play some hate, I got 808s here to save the day
'Cause I am on top of it, lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it
You know my flow is so dominant, positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments
All of these offers is boring as fuck, though I am not a part of 'em
Start a new part to the charts and I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it
Breaking it up, like cartilage, flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it
I know that you hate to admit it, but really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'
Under the radar, you don't know what's comin', I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'
I found to be part of a little of something called love, and I guess that's the art of it
I try to go slow, but it don't work
-Gettin' better, and that don't hurt, and you think I'm dead, and you're sure
You're salty and not kosher, slave to the corporates and the owners
This is live and love, call it Shrek, like the ogre
Hah, bitch, I have had enough, and I am sure I ain't mad enough
Forgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success, and I look at the numbers, I add 'em up
My chart is like a parabola, thank you a lot for havin' us
And so, every day, I take one step up, man, I am takin' the ladder up
-Hundred K- get the plaque, lookin' forward, not heading back
Remember what I had said is that we ain't givin' up, remember that
Hit me up when you're done whining, I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming
Listen up, 'cause I'm combining all my skills into one finding
We run, grinding, you know we do, we got the shit that we're goin' through
These lyrics go over you, you  don't listen, so you don't know it's true
'Cause we in, and we've done it, thousands, now we a hundred
Shoutout to Didac and Momo and the others
Shit, I consider them brothers, shit, I consider you all are my family
Shoutout to those who will stand with me, even when all of the others abandon me
Yeah, drama, we move past that, now I look at you with the last laugh
Better trackback, now I rap fast, so many skills in my backpack
Started off so terribly, now all of these people compare to me
In the past, I never anticipated what there would be
And see ya, so long now, off to the end of the song now
See ya next at five-hundred and a million, it's on now

[Interlude 5]
It's on now
Oh shit, I'm almost out of water
This is a hard- this a- real challenge
This like, physically difficult, ayy

[Hook 4]
When I walk up in the scene, I hear a orchestra
Now everybody telling me I don't perform enough
My math teacher told me that I'd never be shit
And now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula
I got the formula, I got the formula
You got the sauce, but goddamn, I got the formula, ayy
People always asking Ben, "Why you record so much?"
I got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up

[Verse 16]
Formula, like I'm Mr. Krabs
I change and transform it up, you stuck in the past
Yeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab
Uh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag
And now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'
People love to criticize me for the life I've had
They make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'
I make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, ayy
Uh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie
And I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami
Wanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'
Tryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies
Ayy, still saying, "Who would'a thought?", like, who would'a guessed it?
Haven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing
If you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:
Want the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook

[Verse 17]
Ayy, they doubt a fucker with a dream
Looking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah
Looking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens
Serpent's told you, "No," and it's like nothing's as it seems
God damn, I guess I really thought he was the man
I guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham
All that cash he stocked was from a scam
All the views he got was from some spam
I've been living like, "Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?
Why ain't he just sticking to the plan?
How has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?"
I don't get it, I don't really understand
I've been living like, "Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram
I'll do better if I study my exams, do I really wanna stand
Next to all these average fucking sad duds?"
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one

[Hook 5]
Yeah
Hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one
Ayy
Just because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup
Uh, uh, uh
Feel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones
And so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he

[Verse 18]
'Cause he been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine
I've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap
That shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now
I'm making a- minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I'm needin' to figure this out
How did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday
And I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away
But I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one

[Verse 19]
By now, if you're still watching this shit
You are a boss and you deserve some applause for this shit
But we ain't over, we ain't done, though
Am I takin' a break? Are you dumb, bro?
Well, we nearin' 10K, but I still need 30K
While all you sit around, I would rather work than play
Lyrics go through your dome, through your vertebrae
Hit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates

[Interlude 6]
That was actually a pretty good bar
I just wrote that like, right- a second ago, before I recorded this
Ayy, ayy
You know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh

[Hook 6]
Sometimes, I don't know what to think
Sometimes, I don't know what'll
Make it okay, make it okay
I'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, ayy

[Verse 20]
Uh, I wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering
All these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen
All accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence
Often is the result of falling under consciousness
You'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives
You're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie
And I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty
Fearing that, one day ,you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me
No, will I tell you? No, never- I think I'm so clever
But in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better
But I don't ever
Want to go to show, just one mo' letter
I'm a go-getter, I go get A's and get grades
And get A's, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid
Uh... my life is so unusual
To most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable
Can't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral
I'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero
Uh, but you know that I'm capable
You know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available
Feeling so unique and I think it's not explainable
No one hears my lyrics, and says, "OMG, relatable!"
No, that's not what I'm here to give
Been waiting years for this, you're about to experience
Something that I've spent time, money and thought on
Learned about all the times money had thought wrong
Kinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long
I ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot
-Out on the inside, see me on the outside
Always think I'm positive, and never see the downsides
It's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it
Get your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it

[Interlude 7]
Okay
Okay, okay, we're like thirty minutes in
Thirty minutes, but we got thirty-thousand, bro
Fuck

[Verse 21]
Yeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware
I'm like the 'e' that equals all other emcees squared
I'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs
But y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared
I got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of it
Shoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip
Man, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders
It's not about who goes faster, but it's 'bout the man who'll hold his grip
Damn, I got a crazy ass work ethic
Blocked out south east and west, leave in one direction
I finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it
Fuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection
We all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons
Like a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'
Wanted to fuck a nun, started like really badly
And I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar
Can't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'
Yeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person
I base my motivation on my favorite angels words a-
-bout how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, that thing's for certain

[Verse 22]
You keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high
Wanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy
Can't deny I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize
How it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize
And analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed
And take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise
America is very nice, but I'd like to see the world
But I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl

[Verse 23]
In a Mercedes Benz with his lady friends
Crazy Ben is just chillin' with them women, you know they be tens
They be tens or more, they be tens or more
I like to talk to all these people 'cause they marvel at my metaphors
It's free speech, I can say what I want
But these listenin' are tryna make me pay for my talk
They don't like what I'm doin', they don't appreciate the banter
I get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh
Motherfucker, I'ma live for the right time
Fuck that, I'ma live for the moment
Sitting here in the middle of the night time
My mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowin'
Damn, I've been livin' in a headache
Bitches never listenin', they saying that they ready
But I can never believe them
Got these goals and they can never achieve 'em
How can your dreams come true if you ain't willin' to dream 'em?
Damn, that's a lot of shit to think about
Suddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering
What I'm doin', next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out
Made some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh
Got these dreams that I'm livin' out
In my mind's eye, givin' out lots of songs with responses
That I never pictured, wow, damn, damn
This beat's way too holy to rap over
Mental block, my mind's capacities, that's lower
Your raps slower, they lack closure, they lack substance
Like a printer without toner, y'all fillin' pages that have nothin'
Ooh, but I have got somethin' to tell you
I ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you
Speakin' from late nights, I'm thinkin' of Drake's life
Watching these interviews, thinkin' one day I might
Be on that stage right beside all these players
Shit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers
I'll prove it in music I use to influence
I do this way harder than people assumin'
Resumin' my writin', viewin' this lightin'
That puts me to be in the view of the hidin'
I do what they're likin', but that makes 'em hate me
No matter what I do, they just mistake the
Reason I'm flowin', the reason I start up
Not just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks
And- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place
Most to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste
I'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh
I just need a home run, I already loaded bases
I have got so many cases
Been visiting, living in so many places
Experiences that I made me to Emmy
Ben, B-E-N, please, I hope you let me
Be me, I ain't greedy or needy
Believe me, I just want to be on your TV
Get on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase
Damn, yeah, I've been looking at their space
And, one day, I'll be there
I know what I'm doin', I'm already prepared

[Verse 24]
I've been waiting like thirty-thousand years
Tryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear
I'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career
I'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here
Now I earned it, and I'm here to stay
I'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play
Not even seventeen, eighteen, I'm so near to fame
Not really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day
I don't know- I look at the future nostalgically
I'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me
Undoubtably know how to be what I am about to be
To say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me

[Verse 25]
Recently, I have been feeling alienated
My songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em
But, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different
Hate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it

[Verse 26]
People say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen
All will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene
Y'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty
Promise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?
Trapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages
When I would rap on the stages, and now, I laugh at those days, and
I'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song
Move along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns
Who could bomb this whole place up with one great lung?
One great tongue, I am that one great one
On vacation, I vacate to a location
Far away from where people just may run
A light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun
Oh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young
I can murder this beat with no gun, go run
I've too many problems to handle, here, hold one
I just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks
And now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk
Was a great song, catchy at first, but that radio station
Playing it, making it just get to the worst
My head's gonna burst if I hear it again, and I'm sure
I'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth
And now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it
Now the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah

[Verse 27]
Good rappers never get to see the light of day
But when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away
I'll obey... nah, whatever, man, what is this?
I'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business
Nobody witness anything better than when I am showing you this shit
Know I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, "Oh, this kid is big"
Know how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better listen
Till I'm ahead of this shit by all of the inches, 'eah
And when I'm, uh... I'm telling y'all that I got a story
God ignores me, stop the glory, cop is for me in auditory
Not visually, typically, the original me
So unforgivable, so inexplicable, obvious the pinnacle digitally
Damn, that was fast, felt so jammed till I unpacked
And I'm just tryna prove to you the things that I can move on the track
And I'm trying to get a record deal, never ever felt so real
Whenever we're the guests to feel, whenever f-this gets to feel
So different, and I'm loving it, time to change and discover it
Time to make a difference, and I'm living it, so I'm up for it
I always talk to them other kids, them other kids couldn't understand me
One path, making a knot, ain't gonna stop for plan B

[Interlude 9]
I wrote that one a long time ago
That was the first time that I looked- that I- I looked at those again
But you know, I still- I'm not that rusty, not that rusty
I- actually... classic!

[Verse 28]
We just living in the solar system
One big world here to hold the wisdom
One big jail to control the victims
We're all here, tryna find a soul in rhythm
A voice in writing and a choice deciding
Whether or not to follow what the boys are likin'
What the girls are doing, what we gotta be exposed to
Think about who you are, and it's so true
Think about the people who you think have really known you
Do they really know you? Do you even know you?
Damn, that shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet
Sometimes you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be
And lately, it seems to make the extremes
So prominent and dominant in making big dreams
I'm seeing aliens scream
When I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing
But I'm just tryna make it in life
Fuck you to people who be saying it like
I ain't making it right? Take a vacation and hike
I'm chilled out, bitches, getting famous despite
The fact that I'm young and little bit nerdy
And I know a lot of people would consider me early
I'm just a little kid working tryna configure my searches
Tryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens
I'm just me, no, I ain't a victim to hurting
I just see all the people living and burning
So be free, time to be a little bit nervous
It don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbing
And I get it, I don't wanna ever forget it
Guessin' I'm headed towards the ending, and I know it is splendid
So I'll see ya 'round, underachievers
Hop on my wagon, 'cause we dragging late, we gotta be leaving, man

[Hook 8]
So basically, I do this for fun, they ain't making me
I'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growing so fast, we be getting my career from A to Z
And, basically, I'm great you see, I made my life at the age of three
But now, what am I meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me?

[Verse 29]
I've been see' 'ple- misusing their fans, like crooks
Manipulating their audience to catch that hook
They'll believe anything that you'll tell them, look-
You can feed them shit so you can sell your book, haha
But no shots fired, though
Nothing wrong with a little bit of lying though
I mean... look at Fox News
That's the whole premise of their entire show
But no political shit, I always do just enough, I'm a minimalist
Makin the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em, got a couple of synonyms to help you listen to original bits
I got a lot of digital prints, man, your own homedog is a literal bitch
But I'm filling the syllables, it's a little predictable, 'cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids
I got time! Maybe a little too much of it
But you know that I'm tryna move up a bit
People look at me and say my potential has
Got a big max, and you know that I'm lovin' it
So fire, can't handle me with oven mitts
Underground, blessed if you discovered it
Flow is so unique, I got so much to do
Not like any other kid

[Hook 9]
Ayy, yo, what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm comin' to them checks like Usain Bolt

[Verse 30]
Wait so, inhale the fumes while I paint this
Picture: me, I'm sitting in my room and I'm anxious
Tryna make my moves while they huge and they famous
I knew this shit I couldn't do, I was jaded
Now, somehow, I'm next up, yeah, I'm blessed up
Now I wake up and I'm fly, I don't dress up
Now I'm fly and my opponents better catch up
I get my checks, uh, all y'all need to step up
I-I-I-I-I-I- remember tryna practice my cadence
In tracks I was makin', I had to be patient
Everybody said that shit was trash, and they were right
But I turned that shit and made a right, shit is day and night
Now I gotta take a flight to Vegas, might not stay the night
Everybody see me eatin', now they wanna take a bite
So I'm like, "Okay... no way"
Yeah, when it comes to this shit, man, I don't play
I'm like Houdini in my Ghost, you can't see me, I'm gone
Ball so hard, I gotta wear my Yeezys to prom
YouTube bitches asking me to retweet they song
I'm the reason people got Spotify Premium on

[Hook 9]
Like, ayy, yo, what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm runnin' to them checks like Usain Bolt

[Verse 31]
So I'm like okay, nah, no way
When it comes to that shit, man, I don't play
If you ask me how I got it I will say
I got the drive, yeah, really get out of the roadway, uh

[Interlude 8]
Damn
Some of these
Are too slow and also too fast
Whatever

[Verse 31]
I'm out of order, three hoes like I'm Santa Claus
Pull up on your bitch, Bape hoodie with a camouflage
Hey now, yo, what's the play now?
I'm tryna slide, I ain't talkin' 'bout a playground
Yeah, I remember all them days I would stay down
20K's chillin' in my PayPal
So what the fuck you wanna say- you wanna say now? Nothin'
Best in my town and that's no discussion
Humble beginnings, ain't humble, we winnin'
If I wanna brag, that's my humble decision
Everything I do is goin' off
So if I wanna freestyle, then you better know the cost, ayy

[Interlude 10]
I think she blocked me
Damn
There's no more water, I'm literally about to die

[Hook 9]
I think she blocked me on the Instagram
I need to know, what did I do? I guess I missed your plan
Me, I'm just searchin' for that truest shit, where is it, man?
I'll never know, just wanted you to help me understand
I need some closure because, truthfully, I give a damn, I give a damn
Plenty of fish in the sea, but see, I ain't no fisherman
See, I'm a middleman, a businessman, and this means business, man
Diggin' in the sand, lookin for a reason, I'm not kiddin', man

[Verse 32]
How am I gonna let all of this get to me?
Been a few months since you texted me
Shit, I'll just tell myself I'm a celebrity
Ain't no way that this can get to me
And in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter
But right now, it's feeling like everything
The more I talk about it, it just gets sadder
'Member thinkin' about a wedding ring
But now I'm thinkin' 'bout so many things
What did I do to deserve it?
This shit the most petty of petty things
I'll stick with how nobody's perfect
Like all of my life, I'll forget about it
And all of the things that I said about it
But why the fuck did I get blocked?
I just cannot wrap my head around it

[Interlude 11]
I just can't wrap my head around it
Now I'm just getting bored, I'm just fuckin' up all the flows
Just for the fun of it
If you're still watchin' this shit, uh, comment, uh...
Comment "Arrowhead water" in the comments
And let me know what-what would you rate this out of ten
Give me a rating, that way know that you're real-
That you're real one, you know what I'm sayin'? Alright, here we go

[Verse 33]
Spectacular speculations
-Havin' some reservations
Imaginin' all the statements
-Travellin' through these places
Back in, then buy some passionate
Trashin' of reputations
They actually don't have facts, and
Reality left them baseless
I wish that we left 'em nameless
-'Sociate 'em with faces
Make judgments from expectations
And watch as their heads are shaking
-People want me to crumble
And turn to some medication
To fuck up my motivation
And focus on education

[Hook 10]
But I'm petty, petty, petty, petty
That's all they really ever tell me
So many times that you convince me of shit
That I swear you could've won an Emmy
I got a phone in my hand, like a note for the 'Gram
And I'm thinkin' about holdin' your hand, but you don't understand
I think t' 'ove is eith-either gold or a scam
And you never really know till the end, like, how all this began

[Verse 34]
I've been comin' at this as a man
Trying to figure out where I fit into the plan
How does all the drama surround me? I hear 'em followin' loudly
And I don't wanna hear about this shit again
I guess that's the way it goes when they stalk me
And do anything to try and stop me
I did nothing wrong, but that's how it goes
When a basic bitch try to block me, uh

[Verse 35]
Livin' life, but you're stayin' the same
How you expect yourself to go take the fame
Make your name, but you don't take the pain
You wanna be unique but not make a change
Like, what? How you expect to go through this
Think about the goals, man, why you wanna do this
So stupid and useless if you never lose it
Risk yourself a little for the movement- when did I write-
This ain't the Ode to Joy, this the ode to success
Don't know if there is a God, but I know that I'm blessed
And I'm open to "No" and I'm open to "Yes"
I'll do whatever I can to go to the best
That will go to the right and go to the left
No doubt I'ma show up at night instead of goin' to bed
When I know that I'm right, I'm explodin' my chest
I keep on loadin' the time and it goes over my head
I think "No, why do I even try these things?
I need shiny things like diamond rings
And flying rings and pricey bling- uh
That is what drives these strings
I'm so- I'm so lively and lazy at the same time
Sayin' somethin' sane and crazy in the same rhyme
Never go to practice, don't phase me till it's gametime
Learnin' this life will amaze me, how I made my
Day, find a minute, I'm livin', winnin' and willin'
To spit rhythm and chillin', they get so pissed with me, I'm either villain
No, they not kiddin', and no, I'm not quittin', I know I'm just sittin'
Sittin' with a dream, and maybe
Maybe just see then, see then where the dream could take me
But I know it can't, I know it takes luck, I'm angry!
Why am I just the B of the A-team
At the feet of the mainstream? Man, I dream for this daydream!
Uh, and I believe that I'm makin'
Cease for the takin', it's me in the train, and
I see that I'm breakin', my knees aren't place and
I keep on thinkin' that I'm being amazin'
But I'm improvin', I know it's just a slow climb
Pushin' myself, yeah, I'll be there in no time
So I'm movin', I'm movin' till I get there
Get where? I just don't want to get left there

[Interlude 12]
I don't remember
I don't even know what that's from but that was written in there
It's been a lot of late nights, okay?

[Hook 11]
I don't give a fuck about anything
Skinny white child on the track, but I'm threatening, they don't wanna let 'em in
They told me if I take it, I'll feel better, like it's medicine
But I ain't settling, they tryna rush me, like adrenaline

[Verse 36]
And labels don't reply so I can get a deal
I've been itchin' for this shit, someone give me a Benadryl
I get hella skill, man, they worried that I never will
Have success in bills, man, the grill- haha seven mill'
I don't give a fuck about this shit, I've been goin' overboard and now they jumpin' on the ship
Man, they hypocrites, pimpin' they butterflies while they in- okay, that one was work, uh
And want my Christmas as a Christmas gift
Middle child, know I'm anythin' but in the middle, bitch
Man, I don't give a shit, I'm well behaved, and so articulate
I'm the type to ask my fucking teacher for a syllabus
Uh, uh
Existential crisis, every day I think I don't exist
Chicken little, I'm a fryin' pan, I'm a dyin' man
Wake up every mornin', I'ma make a fuckin' diagram
And find a plan to be the highest man in this giant land
Rap so fuckin' hard, I think I'm injurin' my diaphragm
Iron Man, think I'm Iron Man
Kids be puttin' fire emojis on my entire 'Gram, I'm a fireman
Second grade teacher got me singin' in the choir, man
And look at where I am, I never thought I would acquire fans
Acquire bands, say a bunch of random shit and rhyme it, man
That's how much I do not give a fuck, let's go to Ireland
Hundred grand on those rubber bands to hold your fuckin' bands
Listening to the cash register like your fuckin' jam
-Don't understand, like a Republican with a gun in his hand
Sayin' that "Trump is the man to come with the plan", livin' in wonderland
That shit is a fucking scam
Making America show that it's dumb again, ha! Ha...

[Verse 37]
They told me I needed to do a switch up
My friends told me I needed to get my hits up
It ain't that simple, I'm not someone that white teenagers wanna be like
I can't say "Issa" in a meme and have it pick up
Big up, I'm a transnational British person
Dimension C-137's my biggest version
I've been disturbin', music it isn't listed as urban
Air quotes next to my name in red caps, written as burden
I'm a fuckin' burden to every fuckin' person on this Earth, man
I'm determined, I'm tryna get it workin'
Sortin' out pins and needles like an amateur surgeon, that makes no sense
All these listeners are so dense
This song is conversational, so why you still talkin' to me?
I email artists, they haven't responded to me
My camera just went out, so why you still talkin' to me? Uh
I'm trying to give you free money, not fond of your feat
I'm tryna to make a deal, not call the police
I have free publicity, they don't want to be seen
I guess they don't wanna be seen, fuck these monopoly scenes
Uh, yeah, they collab with rappers with fifty plays
I hit 'em up about it and wait sixty days
Now I'm bigger than these rappers I'm askin'
I hit 'em up again, and then I never get a response, damn
What the fuck is happenin'? Damn

[Hook 12]
I said f-
Fuck a lawsuit, fuck a lawsuit, ayy
What'd it cost me is what it cost you, ayy
G-Gotta stop you, y'all are not cute, uh
No need to argue, 'cause I do not lose, ayy, uh

[Verse 38]
Who's your momma? I need to know who taught you, I need to
'Call you believe, but I'm sure that nobody believes you
I'm makin'-I'm makin' music, as soon as I start makin' money, you tryin' to review
You gonna claim every verse on my album, are you gonna claim these too?
'Cause I am independent, you a little jealous, and you skeptical of how I'm really sellin'
You assumin' that I can't legit defend it, I'ma send you out here with a prison sentence
Copyright-abusin' pricks, tryin' to profit off my music shit
Little do you know that I am not afraid of you, and so I will refuse to quit, you stupid bitch
I'm bad for real, my shit got mass appeal, ayy
Every song that I drop is an anthem, you don't really have to kneel, damn
Freestyle, you don't have to steal, don't like it? Well, you have to deal, damn
If I say it that it's how I feel, it's real, I don't pass no drill, damn
Plug called like we had a deal, man, this shit ain't daffodils, damn
When it all comes d- at my door, get the fl- 'oy like a Happy Meal, ayy
If it does, then I have to kill, name a track like the- you pass a d'ill-
Haha, to 'hi-, killer, bum-uh-dum-num, damn, I have to chill
Yeah, this a new wave, y'all are too late
You say you gon' start tomorrow, well, tomorrow's today
I get-I get all these bags, stuff 'em in a suitcase
You a thief, you be stealin' flows like you Boonk Gang

[Interlude 13]
I accidentally quit out all these lyrics
So I was just trying to piece it together like a puzzle
You know what I'm saying? Ayy
Let's gom random shit, ayy

[Verse 39]
I take no credit for anything that I do
That's how I live life with a positive attitude
That's why I've seem pissed, but I'm never gettin' mad at you
That's the reason that people mirror my attributes
What I contribute to the world is
Some crazy shit nobody else's world did
And I'm just tryin' to spread some peaces love
But, man, it's really hard, 'cause you need some luck
I've been waitin', 'cause this is
The best time for me to be layin' out of business, uh
And I'm breathin' in the air, but it all tastes tainted
When all of this time is wasted, really ain't wasted

[Interlude 14]
This is trash, I have- don't know when I wrote this
I think I wrote this in like 2013, this is how far back I-
This is how far back we are, I'm not even gonna rap this
Let's do something else- oh, okay, let's do this

[Verse 40]
It's bumpin', bumpin', this beat is just so disgustin'
You leavin' me in the lust of my meet-and-greet for my lovin'
I'm enchanted, damn, this beat is just full of somethin'
That's makin' me want to get up, and breath in all the percussion
Man, I'm dancing, dancing, man, I'm feelin' the rhythm
Droppin' my head, fancy snares, then when it hits 'em
It really gets in my bloodstream, life just makes sense to me
Bass and a good groove is really a great recipe
Can't mess with me, no one- feelin' too good in the moment
Feelin' new when I go in, and feelin' blue when it's over
And I'm noddin' yes, and then I am applaudin' next
And then, I'm tryna to mentally send God a text
Like, "Hey, what's up, God? I don't know if you're real
But, listen to how this bumps, you supposedly feel
Like a god— well, you get what I'm sayin'?"
And goddamn, I just can't really express when I'm playing

[Hook]
I said it's bumpin', uh- y'all just go for a ride
We feelin' good at the top, man, we more than high
Yeah, we be feelin' it, know that this the realest shit
All the pain, this is healin' it, love it, I'm never leavin' it
It's bumpin'

[Verse 41]
Really, this is bumpin' to me
You ain't feelin' it, so then you just get up and you leave
But this is something to me, so don't come runnin' to me
I said we comin' in this shit like we be fuckin' the dream
No, never mind, probably not
But I constantly got energy that's lost in my thoughts
And I'm not gonna stop, and yes, this may be costing a lot
But lookin' at the end result, man, we've accomplished a lot
And no, I'm not gonna regret a thing after this, I'm still trying to master this
'Cause now, I'm known as that weird-ass rappin' kid
The fact of it is that it is really just a giant hobby
Something for me to be original, not a lyin' copy
Tryna make some shit where you can really get your head nodding
Verses so fire that- 's when it's done, it's- left sobbing
Blah, blah, blah, it's uh- we just a work-in-progress
Some of my shit means shit and other words are nonsense
But now we easin' up, we got a beat that's bumpin'
See me stuntin' while I'm flowin', we adjustin', see me bluffin'
Every day, man, see me bluffin', that is what I do
Listen to some good shit, tryna make a substitute
I got so much stuff to do, and I am just a youngin' too
Who just hopped on the scene? Everybody wonders who
But all I know is that we find a safety in rhythm
And that is the reason that I am making a shipment
I said it's bumpin'

[Interlude 15]
Nearin'- we're nearin' an hour
If you're still watchin' this shit, I love you, I actually, like, love you
Long time, okay

[Hook 13]
I said, I'm married to the game, but I only just met her
Hopin' that my shit get better, but I'm just gonna
Move with it, ride with it
It's my life, the only burden is the time limit
Fuck it, I'm livin', ayy, I said, "Fuck it, I'm livin'"
People getting mad, just because, yeah, I'm winnin'
Just because, yeah, I'm winnin', they're stuck-up, and I get it
Just because your life stucks, stop corrupting mine with it
I messed-I messed up the punchline, it's actually really good
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, ayy
Ayy, ayy, uh
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, uh

[Verse 42]
And how am I meant to keep my workflow up?
If a girl shows up, all my world blows up
I'm just sittin' and waitin', instead of becomin' the greatest
Tryna find a brand new motherfuckin' deal
All you bitches fake, all my numbers real
All my shit is punchin' in your stomach, like a meal
Am I married to the game if I can't afford a ring?
It's all very much the same if I can't afford to sing
Now, it's scary for a king, damn, I said, it's scary for a king, even
They call me odd, but I bring even
I bring reason to believe, and you're eatin' it up for free, and
The meaning is rarely seen and no line can be drawn between 'em, I don't show seasons
Yeah, I am me no matter what, and that can grow pleasin'
I'm barely close to anybody, I don't know people
Man, I don't know people who so equal
I don't know nobody who doesn't own evil
Man, that is just a truth and a lie
A truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky
Or a suit and a tie, yeah, I'm new to this life, I'm new to my mind
New to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise
And uh, I'm- lookin' at all of this shit
Oh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this
You get discouraged for one minute
And the next one, you be callin' it quits
And I'll probably get rich If I focus enough
You close-minded, let's open it up
And all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'
But they do not know what is up
Uh, I just wish
That they'd go away
And I won't obey
No, I will never ever show the way
And I will try to mask it up
With other jokes on fucking jokes
Always playin' G'
But now I'm movin' onto other notes

[Interlude 16]
My voice is fucking hurting
It's hurting a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training
So I don't know how to- just do this for a long period of time
Without causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?
Man, I just live it up
I'm gonna go a little bit quieter now
Uh-huh
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
All of these people keep on changin'
All of these times and different phases
All of these lights on all these stages
All of these sights is so amazing
Yeah, I've seen at least a million faces
A million times, a million places
But when it's all said and done
I look and I wonder why, uh

[Verse 43]
Everyone knows that it's so amazing
All the support is my motivation
Compared to the big people at the Capital
My name is spelt in lower cases
People loved me before I made it
People liked it before they watched it
I'm wantin' way too much more than I have
And I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it
Man on a mission, and I g- vision
Of talking a lot of wisdom, man, I gotta listen
Gotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow
I'll be the teacher when they need the feature
Got flow, and it's so damn crazy
People consider me so amazing
I'm holding control and then folding them verses
It hurts because I am on loaded bases
Advanced shit, I know the basics
Already know them, they're overrated
Meanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hopin'
'Cause now I am open for game, and
I'm charged up
I ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior
So many people they know the players
Don't know the game and don't know the makers
Don't know the fakers, but who cares?
I'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater
I'm here to go move and just go on the layers
And bitch, I am going so later
I got time
My own lyrics, I got mine
And I'm on time for the wrong lines
And I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go

[Hook 14]
I've been all on my own
All on my own, people keep calling my phone
Wanting to know when I'll be the star of the show
But I'm all my own, yeah
And I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it
'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-
The ghost of me is haunting the throne
So I'll make it there all on my own

[Verse 44]
My intermission is mixing with intermissions
And following intuition conflicting with my decision
And it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval
And it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful
And it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you
Appearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement
To a new type of thing that you can gain from
To push away the past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago-

[Interlude 17]
Oh, holy shit!
I actually reached the end of the beat
But I still have, like
Ten-thousand more words
Hold on, I gotta pause this
Hold on, three, it's still one take

[Verse 45]
-Past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago
Look at where we been, but imagine where one can go
It's not fun to know that we just livin' to die
It's not fun to know that we just livin' to die
We now know how much money you can give for a lie
Give for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?
What's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?
So, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen
Always been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man

[Hook 15]
Yeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch
Uh, I ain't the star of the show, bitch

[Verse 46]
I know like four people who truly respect the grind
And it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme
And then if time is money then free time ain't really free
And all my fan' pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me
-Stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree
I want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me
In the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me
Bigger than you, bigger than anybody in history
The challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize
To satisfy your lavish life and have a crazy magic time
And luckily, I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time
To learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind
I'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got
Several different things to potentially make my job
I want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs
And also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks
A million- shit, all we ever want is more, really
And once I get three million, I want four milli'
It's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle
We can never be happy, but that is so vital

[Interlude 18]
Uh
Those are actually some good lyrics, uh

[Verse 47]
Rebirth, feet hit the earth, my knees hurt
They're weaker than previously, her
Breathing seems to be burnt like free CDs were
Before we could be searched, I'm like "Please, just please work"
Like a lenient slave owner— that's edgy, like gravestones, oh, you get me
I saved dough for a Bentley, t'ere more than a Chevy
I play- I play-
-Who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy?
Uh, I've been tryin' to prove to all of the people I knew who didn't like what I do
Disgusted like, "Ew", yeah, this shit goes outta you, plans have now all become true
I'm seeing them through, man, that's the reason I do, all of the things that I do
It's not for a crew, not for a god or a demon, I've really been needing a clue
Fillin' these shoes, reading these pieces and news, damn, this shit really is screwed
It gives me the blues whenever I'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh
But if ignorance is really bliss, then why this ignorance be killin' kids?
And why this ignorance that's clearly vicious is not given shit and ends up innocent?
That shit really is ridiculous, it's magnificently fucked up
But nobody wants to tough it up, I haven't seen it goin' down, it's comin' up
L—

[Verse 48]
—cay to the Vatican, havin' them
Good times and bad times with New Romans, do that again, well, that was when
I was so young, too young to really know fun
But so what? I guess that's what happens when you grow up
Dry your eyes and wipe your nose up
Just keep drinking till you throw up, no, we won't judge
But we all just want to be loved and somehow get validated by those we hate
Such a twisted system that we've been given to operate
I've been really thinkin' and figurin' out who's not a fake
Wash away the thoughts I made along the way, it all has changed
Yeah, and now we lookin', it's so far away
And it's so far away

[Hook 16]
This a civil war
It's a fuckin' civil war
Yeah, we be aimin' to the peace
So what we killin' for?
Yeah, anymore
What we even livin' for?
Yeah, they be murderin' for peace
That is a civil war

[Verse 49]
You know- you know they be lookin' at me right now
Like the sewer system, they about to pipe down
I've been writin' my essays, my webpage
Yeah, I call that a new construction site now
Blue's Clues, man, I think I gotta find out
All these questions, man, I really wanna hide out
Or I wanna drop out, maybe learn a lot 'bout
My shit before I wait to see it die out
Damn, I-I just wanna go along
I'm holdin' strong, I know- I know I'm not the boldest one
I'm old enough, I'm growin' up, bars so sick, they throwin' up
They know what's up, now, I'm in the- now I'm really doin' the
Doin' in the big leagues like I got drafted
Before the year-round hype over March Madness
Wanna get it to where these girls strippin' down
Like it's no big deal, like we takin' liberal arts classes
They be sayin', "Damn, Ben really got savage"
No, but unlike you, I am not average-

[Interlude 19]
Hold on, I have to fix this fucking instrumental
This is so mental, hold on, I have to fix it real quick
I'm gonna fix it, take a pause
Uh, yeah, ayy

[Verse 50]
I'm addicted to the screen and the validations
Of people who are thirteen in another nation
I've been looking for acceptance in the message
Or a comment on a video, it seems to be wasted
Like Internet track meets, they erased it
Look at this shit, I've just recently made it
That how it goes when I'm beatin' and breathin'
Acheivin' and keep on succeedin', they hate it
Y'all lousy and can't breathe all that smoke, bro
You doubt me, but you'll see where I go, so
Allow me to break free from my own dome
To get out and be me, believe in my own zone
Things become intense in the heat of the ozone
It's surroundin' me, I need to go home, so
Can I pretty please just be al-alone?
Nobody to retweet, delete on my home phone
I ain't gon'-I ain't gon' hop on that drug shit
When they all claimin' they love it, uh
I ain't gon' hop on that loud shit
When I know I ain't about it, uh
Yeah, they cannot take this away now
They have something to say now
You cannot order this shit on a takeout
All of these bitches is fake now

[Verse 51]
—My clothes is Japanese, I wear it casually
And I'm a killer on the mic, might cause a couple casualties
-All I'm needin' is a beat to make your fuckin' salary
Man, I said, "Fuck the peanut gallery, I got a fuckin' allergy"
Trappin' out my PayPal, make it Friends and Family
Now I'm so hot, I need some oven mitts, ain't safe to handle me
Now I made my checks from Spotify, they pay me handsomely
I got the mic up to my brain to help maintain my sanity, okay
Everybody 'round me, they been wasting my time, ayy
Pull up to the functions, see they face when I rhyme, ayy
Everyone's a critic on my case all the time
Do it by myself, I don't need a way to get signed

[Hook 17]
Bitch, I'm clouted up, yeah, I'm clouted up, ayy
Get my numbers up, gotta add 'em up, ayy
Until I get it, I ain't never packin' up, no
And they all comin' for my blood like Dracula, ayy

[Verse 52]
Okay, I'm backin' this, not maskin' shit, now everybody wanna go package shit
I don't give a fuck, you know I'm abstinent, I'ma fuck the whole game up on accident
Wait a minute, shit, I'm too passionate, so they stand up for my anthems, no Kaepernick
'Member when they used to all laugh at this, now they hit me up like, "What the fuck's happenin'?
Yeah, I had to sacrifice a lot of sleep
Because a lot of people want a lot from me
Yeah, standing in the way of who I wanna be
Now random strangers recognize me when I cross the street

[Verse 53]
So many memories, do you remember these
Moments way back in the time?
Trapped in the back of my mind
I am so happy to grind, I am so happy to find
So much experience now that I'm passing the lines
Now that I'm grasping the signs
I have been laughing a lot, got nothing to hide
No, I've got nothing to hide
Bitch, I am stuck, left behind
I need a drive, yeah, I need something to ride
Fill my own bank account, shit that I'm making now
Puttin' it off to the side
Feeling alive, yes, I am breathing the air
And I'm feeling so careless, but I can't
Let go
Damn
Every morning
I'm wanting to drop out
But I can't stop now
I put too much work in this shit to go pop out
So I walk down five different paths every day
Just need the one, it's only begun
No, I'm not going away
No, I'm not gonna- 's uh- say
That this shit is going badly at all
I'm glad that I fall
I love the ref, but I am mad at the call
I'm mad at the call
Yeah, I'm having it all, I'm traveling far
And I'm practicing hard
Never goin' back to the start, never goin' back to the start

[Verse 54]
Uh, yeah
Putting my mind on the table
No, I am so able, I'm lining the cables
I got the horsepower, but tied to the stables, get by with no label
I do the mixing and mastering
Writing and rapping and making it happen, I'm
Eating my cake, and I'm having it
Real emotion, I'm tapping in, passionate
And I am working my hardest
It's already started, yes, I am being an artist
I'm feeling the largest
I'm feeling the largest

[Part III]

[Intro 3]
Oh!
Is that the final beat change up?
Alright, we were on that last beat for like an hour
For lit- literally an hour... um..
But you know what? Gotta hop on this classic beat, ayy
Uh
Yeah
Had to change it for all you that have been watching till
Till the end, you know?
You didn't think that beat was ever gonna change, but it did, though
Uh, yeah
Ayy

[Verse 55]
Recently, I've been feeling my lyrics missing meaning
I'm trying to whitewash how much they stink like I'm Listerine-ing
Damn, I'm feeling like I've missed the key, and
So I guess that DJ Khaled is always skipping me
But, yeah, you know I'm tryn  do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
Yeah, you know I'm tryn  do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
I got new crews and the new friends, got new views in a new lens
I'm the new dude, I'm the new Ben, got my YouTube with the new trends
But the way I'm growing is so unorthodox
How could I be connecting them if I have yet to sort the dots?
Sorta lost and very found at the same time
I pour the cost, now I'm very loud in a daytime
And very quiet at night- seem to shine when I write
And I'm longin' to be a five-year-old, chillin', flyin' a kite
And I admire the sight of somebody else workin' more than me
I've been staying grounded, but the sky is movin' towards my feet
And fortunately, I'm on course, living morally
Grinding to get what's rightfully mine, I'm headed right for my dream
Damn, I guess that's all I need to know for now
They put me in the driver's seat, no way I'm slowing down
They know me now but don't know my sound, it is so profound
Give m- two years and I'll make it, let me show you how
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 56]
I gotta stop all of this bragging shit
So many haters, S.M.H. is the acronym
I'm tryna get a couple "OMG"'s
Or a, "WTF, he is so sexy"
I got no Bentley, beat is so deadly
Walked up to the rap club, no entry
And I feel a little like I won't get seen
'Cause I'm so white, won't fight, don't get me
'Cause I'm coming at this music with a different set of ideas
Trying to bring my own crib like it's Ikea
Here's a pro-tip: take no tips
From people who aren't pros yet, bitches always so stressed
Damn, 'cause they trying to find that great escape
Nation of dreamers who all just trying to stay awake
Every day, I be waking up to my 808s
Day-to-day hustle, I'm just trying to pave a way
People with the problems always give the most advice
Like, why don't you sort your own life? Don't come close to mine
I'm mostly fine, so please leave me alone to whine
And next time that you're talking shit, please bring me an open mind
'Cause people locking they own ideas in straitjackets
I'm David Blaine's magic- helping you break past it
I'm trying to raise havoc, not trying to stay savage
Trying to make balance while finding a great passion
Climbing to get up this- witnessin' injustice
By who people in love with or based off of skin colors-
Shit is so disgusting- seeing it in public
I'm trying to make sense of it here in the discussions-
Close my eyes and go to sleep, waiting until they notice me
Wait until my creations are making everything so complete
My thoughts are scattered- find lots of patterns
I try not to let it get my plots in ashes

[Verse 57]
I don't ever think I've- some money, some- little talent
These rappers' shows look like lip-sync battles with Jimmy Fallon
What really happened? I'm jealous if people selling platinum
Worst year of my life? That's like saying the worst Kendrick album;
It's way better than average, I'm already established
Unforgettable classic, y'all shit is set to go plastic
They want to see me disappear like incredible magic
Your regrettable attitude is upsetting my passion
I'm getting listens and play, fuck all the simpler days
I just took a moo- mon- break- I got Spotify paying me minimum wage
I'm like that's good enough, man, I've been eating, ain't full enough, I just want to make it pulling up
I've been putting up with all of these amateurs, sure enough, I'ma show 'em how it should be done

[Verse 58]
I got green and I want beef like a omnivore
I got that exclusive flow that can't be bought at stores-
All this new shit, they still be wanting more
They say that my duty is not fair like some modern war
I'm stacking rolls, just like the Michelin Man
Eating sushi every night, but I don't live in Japan
Damn, I'm trying to get as many hits as I can
And like a lazy-ass beaver, I ain't giving a damn
Woah, this shit is corny, you really gonna ignore me?
You really gon' let it slide when these Benjamins do adore me?
And as we rise, man, it ain't about fame and fortune
We got a greater importance, that's why I wake in the morning
I'm tryna play a performance- make a change with a chorus
I came from a tiny platform, but now my stage is enormous
Flawless, do anything to stay out of office
'Cause I'm cautious, not gonna sell my soul for the profits

[Verse 59]
Yeah, I got many dreams, lot of passions
I'ma get there by any means, just imagine
Just know that anything can happen
Take chances, put everything in rapping
I don't even really need to go fast
Flow back, not wandering like a nomad
So glad, yeah, they all melt like a snowman
Back-to-back flames got Drake sayin', "Oh, man"
Not again, got a lotta friends who wanna end
All my shit, unsubscribe like I'm On Demand
I've been living in a moment, got a lot of fans
Pedophile back at it again with the white vans
Can't lie, man, I got a lot of white fans
Could I get a ultralight beam, maybe by chance?
Every day I've been switching up on my stance
Scare everyone away whenever I dance
People in the comments saying that I can't rap
Okay, 'cause I didn't understand that
Fuck you, man, I think it's time to stand back
You'll be sittin', gettin' in the way like a sandbag
If you want to talk trash, say it to my face
I'll be singin', "La-la", I got two LA's-
I be laughin', "Haha" at the human race
Hey, I'm in the lead, not far from a newer place
Uh- gettin' sick and sicker
The flow on the track gettin' quicker and quicker
Shiver me timbers, I'm winnin' these bigger
Killer victor, not swipin' left like it's Tinder
They filter my picture, put it in bad light-
Uh, me playin' these rappers is a bad fight
Ayy, me spittin' these bars, that's a mad sight
Haters be changin' their opinions, is that right?
Ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm winnin'- I'm winnin'- I'm spittin' a million words per the minute
I'm in it to win it, I'm in it to win it, I'm fixin' to hit it, uh
This shit is my mission, not up to your opinions
You know that I'm grinnin', ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 60]
But I don't wanna be a ribbon in the sky
Livin' in disguise, man, I see the venom in the middle of their eyes
Figure if you're livin' or you die
'Cause it's time for you to finish your reply
I've been dealin' with these guys, know that I ain't black and I rap
So I guess I'm automatically wack, when, matter of fact
I am better than like half of these actors
Outdated, like a battery pack that a Blackberry has
On the back of its tab
-Rapping has the wrath of attack to send a missile back to Iraq
Then leave a crack on the map
And put my train of thought right back on the track, oh
All these rappers out of breath
-That gasp like a motherfuckin' asthma attack, yeah
Match, match, match, makin' flames when I swipe right
And I ain't talkin' 'bout some crap on an app
-Blowin' up with bars like a TNT
Blowin' up: TNT, with bars: AT&T
I'm the one you may see on a screen
I won't be passin' out like, "Hey! Is he on lean?"
Nah, I ain't about that
The music that I make is a motherfuckin' soundtrack
To the dopest life, Big Sean better bounce back
Everybody tryna raise the stakes? Well, they better take it out back
I got a lot on my mind, I cannot go behind
Uh, ayy, ayy, ayy
I just deleted the- all those lyrics
But that don't matter, 'cause I'm sayin' them in spirit, bitch, uh!

[Verse 61]
Who would'a, who would'a thought
That Quadeca woulda moved to the top? I've been doin' a lot, ayy
See me for the music I make
Not the views, not the shoes that I bought
I mean who would'a thought that I'd go up, up and away?
5K to 100K in a month how I play
'Fucker think he runnin' the game
See these haters, now they runnin' away 'cause I've come here to stay
Comin' from the jump in L.A.​
But a boy been comin' up in the Bay, where they utter my name
Man, I'm like, "What-what do I say
To a friend who think we one in the same?" 'Cause I'm done with the games
Sayin' "This is fuckin' insane"
Wanted bars, well, no one can complain, yeah, they lovin' the claims
I got an abundance of pain
When I drop it, it just bust into flames, it just bust into-
Yeah

[Hook 18]
Who would'a, who would'a thought
That a motherfucker'd hop on UK vibe like I'm Drake?
Ayy, who would'a thought
I'd be spittin' all these syllables without makin' a single mistake?

[Verse 62]
But, I've actually- I've actually made a lot of mistakes, ooh, ooh
I've made a- made a lot of mistakes, ooh
I'm so big, I make hippopotamus shake, ooh
That's-that's really bad, ayy

And you know I compile it in a compilation
Everybody, man, you know that I be livin', ah-ma-raisin
Uh, ah, uh, I don't- didn't even say a real word there
Didn't say a real word
You a real nerd, I'll be flying like a real bird

Uh, word up, it's just like fucking nineties
People looking at me, but they never gonna find me
Like Tekashi, you better come test my gangster
People lookin' at me, but never gonna thank ya
Actually, don't test my gangster, 'cause I don't claim to be one
People lookin' at me, and I'm great, and they see ones
See fun, see ma- I just see more
Uh, yeah, your name is Seymour
Your dad's name is Seymour
I was doin' this shit, like way before
I was on tour, because I just had to take a detour
Uh, and you know that I des-
Destroy, destroy
Who are you? But I'm me, boy, but I'm- uh, me-me, boy
I don't do this shit, I just do this shit
All these rappers, man, you know that I am ludicrous
And I'm movin' bricks to the top of the charts
People lookin' at me, and you know that I'm not gonna start
I'm always gonna do it, 'cause I'm never gonna stop
People lookin' at me, now I'm sendin' all these shots
To the top of your dome, hit you, whip 'em in the dome now
Uh, and your bars, they get thrown out
And you know that I be doing this, I'm goin' down
Uh, but I'm goin' up, you goin' down!
I had to re- had to- had to do a re-phrase
You know how I had a great day
Uh, I might pull up wit' an AK
Uh, and you know I'm gonna make a great plate
Great plate, great escape, I lost my style
I lost my style.. okay
That was a- actually a pretty good freestyle, damn
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 65]
-Money on the run, that's running business
-Do this shit for fun? That's some decision
Coming in this, I wondered, "Is this a road that they'll be fucking with?"
They loving it, making paper, like Dunder Mifflin
Still got haters and doubters I keep on running into
-Got a problem? Hop on the track, I'd love to diss you
People hate on successes, you got some fucking issues
Like- damn, need me to get you another tissue?
Just please don't go- come back, no one'll miss you
Well, I won't, I'll shrug my shoulders and just continue
On my mission, encountered a lot of villains
I'm kicking them down repeatedly lyrically, like it's some Jujitsu

[Verse 66]
Uh, damn
You know that I am the fucking man
Uh, I'ma make this money, make a hundred grand
I don't really think that you'll understand
Understand, 'cause I'm back again
A fan again, I'm going to war, like Afghanistan
What's the plan?
The plan- the plan, man, to plan man?
I'ma do the shit, I'ma do the same thing
I'ma do this shit goin' on my campaign
Celebratin' every day, I'm drinkin' champagne
Ooh, and you're gonna know my damn name
Gonna know my last name, now they see me in the rap game
Uh, they look at me like, "How that changed"
But- t-truly nothing even changed, though
Uh, all these rappers got the same flow
So it's good to evolve, like Play-Doh
'Cause I get molded, I get molded every day, bro
Every day, bro, but I ain't Jake Paul
Sliding into home base with your bitch; baseball
Hey! And now, you're gonna go fall
Uh, but you know I'm gonna go far
I might go in Mario Kart in a go-kart
I got people, now you know I'm goin' so far
So far, but I'm never gonna backtrack
I got all these people send me pics on the Snapchat
But I don't even use Snapchat
People lookin' at me, I might move that back
To the past rap, I be doin' mad facts
All my math facts in my math class, I got backpacks
On my back-back, bag-bag it up
I got all this money, now I stack-stack it up
Oh, ayy, freestylin's pretty fun, though
To be honest, you be lookin' like a dumbo
Oh, oh, who's the winner, bitch?
You already know who won, bro!
That's-that's a horrible bar, bitch
Bar, bitch in my car, bitch
I just do this shit, I'll do this shit like an Arby's, Ar- bitch
I don't know, I just do this shit, uh
And you know that I am too legit, uh

[Verse 67]
Well, who has ever flown like this?
The only kid who's so legit and going in
They focusing, they noticing, they know it's him
Got doors I be opening
Uh- game like some Yeezy's, I've just broken in
They all convinced that I ain't supposed to win
Now my flow's like water, 'cause it's soaking in
They won't go swim, more salty than a ocean is
I'm floatin' in-

[Verse 68]
Seen as automatically wack, uh
Like an asthma attack, havin' ass in the back of your class
But you know that I don't give a motherfuckin' half of a crap
Matter of fact
I ain't never gon' be packin' my bags, and that's a wrap

[Verse 69]
People lookin' at me, now they likin' how I rap, uh
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap song
People looking at me, know my rap is that long
It's too long, too long, might make a few songs, uh
I be gettin' bread like a crou-crouton
Cuttin' out my paper like a coupon
Uh, might rate it like Groupon
Get your group on, jget your raps on
People looking at me, now I make a rap song
Uh, uh, when I'm with your girl, I last long
That's a fact, bitch, better put it up and fact
That's a fact, better put it up in stone writin'
People lookin' at me, they be like "I don't like it"
Well, that's too bad, I might have to go bike you
Off to the ship because, to be honest, man, I don't like you
Don't like you and that is the true shit
Uh, now you lookin' like a U, bitch
Rubik's Cube, but I ain't Logic
Uh, uh, don't do this shit for the profits
Let's be honest, I gon' make a promise
Uh, now you know that I be on this
Old advertisement, phone service, Vonage
Bon voyage, bitch, I'm on this
Uh, uh, got a Hamlet

Now, they see me on the map, ooh, ooh
See me on my stats, almanac, ooh, ooh
Now they want to get it back
But they never get it back, see me, I'm settin' you back
Like eighty-five years, that's a fact
I don't know why I said that
But let's get back to the main shit, uh
Now, they see me on the playlist
Main, now I'm makin' hits, they sayin' that I'm dangerous
Now, they be comin' when I'm playin' this
Playin' this in a- in a car, though
Now, you're lookin' like a weirdo
Now you know that, I'm here, though
Uh, I ain't drinkin' no beer, though
I'm growing out my beard, so
Long, but you can't even see it
Me, now you wouldn't want to be it

I don't, I may use another beat, but I make it my own
Now, everybody, I am takin' my throne, stayin' alone
Now you know that I just stay in my zone

Your career is done, it found it in the lost and found
Damn, that could have been sick if I'd delivered it
People lookin' at me, now they really want to figure this
I'm makin' millions, but I am not a Brazilian
You know I'm skillin' it, everybody know I'm killin', that I'm killin' shit
I'm killin' shit, but I am a murderer
I ain't a murderer, I ain't a murder, see
I murder shit, do this shit to, like, the third degree
And now people lookin' at me, they ain't heard of me
But to be honest, man, I even heard of you
Uh, people lookin' at me, I ain't gon' murder you
Uh, the only thing I murder is this beat
People lookin' at me, now they turn it on and see
Now they turn it on and hear it, now they know I got the spirits
And they listen to my shit, now they likin' all my lyrics, oh
Ayy, now I'm readin' all this Shakespeare
Ayy, aren't you glad that I came here?

People lookin' at me, now I'm gonna send you home
You a metronome, I can do this shit with no metronome
Uh, now you know I don't get at home
I don't do this shit, but I do it a lot
People, you know that I'm doin' it, I'm movin' my thoughts

Motherfucker, you know this some real shit
Hey, hey, uh, you know I got the formula

I love you long time, for so long
Seriously, if you actually did that
I'ma send you a Kit Kat

[Outro]
I'ma send you a Kit Kat to your home
So you can eat it
And then enjoy it, 'cause it's a Kit Kat and Kit Kats
Are candy
Alright, this is the most mentally-exhausting
Mentally-draining thing I've ever done
But it was pretty fun, it was pretty fun
I'm still rhymin' when I'm not even tryin' to
They say, "How you, uh, rhyme when you ain't tryin' to?"
I don't know
That's just what I'd like to do
That's just what I like to do, you know?
I'm just gonna end this shit now, so, uh
If you enjoyed it, drop a like and subscribe
Uh, you know that is what I try to advise
Put it in vision to your vision, get a knife to your eye
Put an incision to your vision, get a knife to your eye
Oh, the beat just ended conveniently!
Great, the beat just ended conveniently, hahaha
I'm s- not strict, I do my lyrics leniently

Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home
Mm

Maybe surrounded by
A million people, I
Still feel all alone
I just want to go home
Oh I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters
That I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
I'm fine baby, how are you?
Well I would send them but
I know that it's just not enough
The words were cold and flat
And you deserve more, than that

Another airplane
Another sunny place
I'm lucky, I know
But I wanna go home
I've got to go home

Someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
'Cause this was not your dream
But you always believed in me

Another winter day
Has come and gone away
In either Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home
I miss you, you know

Let me go home
I've had my run
Baby, I'm done
I wanna go home
Let me go home
It'll all be alright
I'll be home tonight
I'm coming back homeEmbed
