[Intro]
Go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardí like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday

[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed

[Verse 1]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty nines in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, then the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed, hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey, nigga, roll that weed up (Roll that)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A., they sayin', "50, you hot" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)
Now shawty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow (Uh-huh)
Her girlfriend with her, they bi and they ready to go (Okay)

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Rubbed)

[Bridge]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryna pull me back, right?
When my joint get to bumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me, "Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let 'em hate, and watch the money pile up"
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be
[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Hahahaha)

[Outro]
Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither, nigga
We in the club all the time, nigga, so pop, pop off, nigga

Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes

140 ContributorsSeven Nation Army Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Takin' their time right behind my back
And I'm talkin' to myself at night because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind, behind a cigarette

[Pre-Chorus]
And the message comin' from my eyes says, "Leave it alone"
[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it comin' back my way, I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear, but that's what I'll do

[Pre-Chorus]
And the feelin' comin' from my bones says, "Find a home"
[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm goin' to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me and I will think no more

[Pre-Chorus]
And the stains comin' from my blood tell me, "Go back home"

Lose Yourself by Eminem

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better
[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

Where Is The Love? by Black Eyed Peas

178 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsEnglishWhere is the Love? Lyrics[Verse 1: will.i.am]
What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

Where is the love, the love, the love?

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself
[Post-Chorus: will.i.am]
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

Now sing with me, y'all (One world, one world)
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)

I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now

[Breakdown: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

Like a Stone by Audioslave

67 ContributorsLike a Stone Lyrics[Verse 1]
On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

[Verse 2]
And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone

[Guitar Solo]

And on I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone75Embed

Sing For The Moment by Eminem

340 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEnglishItalianoहिन्दीEnglishAzərbaycanca / آذربايجانDeutschSvenskaSing for the Moment Lyrics[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)
You might also like[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, so we can—
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man

And no one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

He seemed impressed by the way you came in
"Tell us a story, I know you're not boring"
I was afraid that you would not insist
"You sound so sleepy, just take this, now leave me"

[Pre-Chorus]
I said please don't slow me down if I'm going too fast
You're in a strange part of our town

[Chorus]
Yeah, the night's not over, you're not trying hard enough
Our lives are changing lanes, you ran me off the road
The wait is over, I'm now taking over
You're no longer laughing, I'm not drowning fast enough

Now every time that I look at myself
"I thought I told you, this world is not for you"
The room is on fire as she's fixing her hair

I Miss You by blink-182

I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

Your Body Is a Wonderland by John Mayer

34 ContributorsYour Body Is a Wonderland Lyrics[Verse 1]
We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

[Verse 2]
Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

I know you're mine all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

You'll be there when the money comes (Comes)

Now, I ain't worried about a thang 'cause I just hit me a lick

And uh-uh, and there ain't nothin' you can say to a player
'Cause doo-wop, she fly like the planes in the air
That's right, she full-grown, settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' her ozone
So fly like a dove, fly like a raven
Quick to politic with some fly conversation
In a natural mood, then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools, blowin' out by the pool
She like my sexy cool mama, we'll blaze on the Bravada
Rockin' Dolce Gabbana, hydro in a Cubana

When marimba rhythms start to play

Hold me close, sway me more

Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

But don't think it's too late

Uhh, uhh, uhh
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B holla

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh, no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
Six hundred drops, hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
[Verse 3: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)

When I'm Gone by 3 Doors Down

18 ContributorsWhen I’m Gone Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
But somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Well maybe it's too far away, yeah
Or maybe I'm just blind
Or maybe I'm just blind

[Chorus]
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But, see, my nigga went to do a little acting
Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one, pass 'em
Drip-drip-drop—there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks (Thanks!)
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat 'rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass?

The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well, I was looking at them, there, there, on the dance floor
Now, they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
'Specially the big girl
Big girls need love, too—no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
And let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out "Timber!" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male-friend-boyfriend was boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail: on the low, ho

Or read in the magazines
Celebrities who want sympathy
All they do is piss and moan
Inside the Rolling Stone
Talking about how hard life can be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd like to see them spend a week living life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they'd fall, they would fall, fall...

They're always complaining, always complaining
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions, think we should rob them

Well, did you know if you were famous you could
Kill your wife? And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were
Smoking crack, McDonald's wouldn't even want to take you back
You could always just run for mayor of D.C.​

I holler at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless, me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her when I'm done, I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
This ain't no secret, you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
'Cause I need four TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho, make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit (Trick)
[Chorus]
I don't know what you heard about me (Yeah)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Woo)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see (Uh-huh)
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me (Uh-huh)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Yeah)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Outro]
Yeah
In Hollywood they say, "There's no business like show business"
In the hood they say, "There's no business like ho business," you know?
They say I talk a little fast, but if you listen a lil' faster, I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, bitch

She stay in the club, like to be seen, she got it honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas

All the high rollin' cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half steppin', she strapped with a nice weapon

Picture (feat. Sheryl Crow) by Kid Rock, Sheryl Crow

Livin' my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord, I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

[Chorus: Kid Rock]
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her (Ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Sheryl Crow]
I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows, but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waitin' on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

[Chorus: Sheryl Crow]
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him (Ooh)
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him (Ooh)

Since you've been gone, my world's been dark and grey

I hoped you were comin' home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away (Drink you away)
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

[Chorus: Kid Rock & Sheryl Crow, Kid Rock]
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home (Ooh-ooh)

'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vow's
Maybe, I'm speaking general now
But girl I'mma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikini's in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On 5th Ave. shopping spree's, and them dinners to Chow's

As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous it's the principle now, I'm so into you

I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary and VS dipped Jesuses
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becoming too stressful
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Bart, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, uh, yeah
[Chorus: Tamia]
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you

[Bridge: Tamia]
I, really like (Ooo-ooo-ooh)
What I feel, when I'm with you (With you)
You're a dream come true (You're, oh yeah, yeah)
Don't you ever leave my side (Ever leave my side, oh no)
Cause it feel so right (Oh baby, oh I)

[Chorus: Tamia]

Hit her up with some pimp-pimp fluid

Knocked up 9 months ago
And what she finna have? She don't know
She want neo-soul, this hip-hop is old
She don't want no Rock n' Roll
She want platinum or ice and gold
She want a whole lot of something to fold
If you a obstacle, she just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary is bad, and these streets she done ran
Ever since when the heat began
I told her "Girl, look here, calm down, I'mma hold your hand
To enable you to peep the plan, cause you's quick to learn
We can make money to burn if you allow me to lay this game"
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread my wings
And the world finna know my name

[Verse 2:  Cody Chesnutt]
I don't ask for much these days
And I don't bitch and whine if I don't get my way
I only want to fertilize another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow roots standing where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lover's back
And I'm keeping my secrets mine

[Hook 1: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her "Rock n' Roll"

And it's weighing a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is The Only One
And Black Thought is bad, these streets he done ran
Ever since when the game began
I never played the fool, matter of fact, I been keeping it cool
Since money been changing hands, and I'm left to shine
The legacy that I leave behind be the seed that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much, but enough room to spread these wings
And the world finna know my name, now listen to me

I don't beg from no rich man
And I don't scream and kick

Ooh, ooh, ooh no, dear

(I did everything a good man would to make it work)
Girl, you should have told me you had second thoughts
(Like before I put the down on the house we bought)
Now I'm thinkin' you and me was a mistake
(But then it hits me and I'm missin' all the love we made)
Girl, I know that we've been goin' through some things, yeah

I like the all-white, high-top, strapped with the gum bottom

I leave them strapped and laced, they come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em, I damn near shot 'em

Kyjuan:
Now if you look and see lime green Forces, it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop, my niggas flip-flop
Yeah my Force Ones in tip-top now form a flip-flops

Ali:
I like the limited edition, the khaki, and army green
Patent leather, pin stripes, you should see how I do the strings
Size 12 with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depends on when and where I'm at

I said, "Excuse me, miss, I only wanna buy shoes"
She said, "I love you, Murph, especially in the white and blue"
I said, "The white and blue? Sounds nice, make it twice"
Then I signed an autograph, "Thanks for the advice"
Ali:
Yo, I keep it real dirty, dirty, you know how I do
Purple and gold with the Lakers, the Broncos, the orange and blue
I like floppy with ankle socks, lows, mids, and high-tops
With the clear sole but it's Tims and fat laces when is cold
But when the winter go (brr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all-purpose with them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stoppin' this dough that I'm spendin' fo sho'
On them Nike Air Force N-E behind the O

Kyjuan:
Ok, Lee, I treat my shoes like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and the wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh with electric roof
Plus I put a kit on the sole, now I got a wider shoe (ooh)
You see that low misk with the purple coop, I'm driving them
(Kyjuan where you getting them colors, are you dyein' them?)
10 is my size in them, and no point in tyin' them
Ain't no point of trying these on, they know I'm buying them

Nelly:
Now, don't nothing get the hype on first sight like white on whites
Them 3 quarters, the lows, they all tight
The only problem, they only good for one night
'Cause once you scuff 'em, you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis, the looks on store owners' faces
This kid is outrageous, he buying 'em by the cases
'Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces

Walk in the mall, and they know what I'm 'bout say
Gimme the black, and the platinum, and leather gray
The ones in the back and the pair you got on display

Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Fabolous, Lil' Mo]
Baby girl, you know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect you, gangsta
Treat you like a princess and put some on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the startin' lineup ain't playin' right
I come off the bench wit' her
It might sound like I'm gassin' ya
But it take time to get from the backseat to the passenger
We been creepin' and sneakin' just to keep it from leakin'
We so deep in our freakin' that we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey's a little bit uptight
Wonder why I keep coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright, if y'all bump heads, it'll be a fight (Mmm)
But I said it'll be alright, c'mon

[Chorus: Mike Shorey, Lil' Mo, Both]
I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)

To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket (Oh)
You gon' play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry 'bout you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin' I denied
Somethin' I would slide just to do somethin' in the ride
But shorty, there's somethin' you provide
'Cause the entrée ain't as good (Mmm)
Without somethin' on the side, you know?

It's gon' be a clip tossed if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback

If she catch me wit' a empty Magnum wrapper (Ooh, yeah)
So keep it on the down low, call the car celly (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

You know I care for you (Care for you)
Anytime this chick is there for you (There for you, yeah)
These feelings I'ma share wit' you
Which makes it a little more clear for you

Mm

[Verse 1: Christina Aguilera]
So, what, am I not 'sposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Whoa)

So what do we do girls? Shout louder!

Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera & Lil' Kim]
This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world) (Yeah)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Respect your worth)

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
Here's something I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, then sex her raw
If a girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's alright though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]
You're just a little boy, you think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
Said you're just a little boy, all you do is annoy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
This is for my girls!

This is for my girls all around the world, oh

If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)

[Verse 1]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this
[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 3]
Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, "She's my Queeeeeen"
[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

It's been too long and I'm lost without you

Straight from high school, you up and left me

Rise & Fall (feat. Sting) by Craig David, Sting

4 ContributorsCraig David - Rise and Fall (ft. Sting) (Traduction Française) Lyrics[Refrain] x2
Sometimes, in life, you feel the fight is over
And it seems as though the writings on the wall
Superstar you finally made it
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall

[Couplet 1]
I always said that I was gonna make it
Now it's plain for everyone to see
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners
Just casualties
I know that everything is gonna change
Even the friends, I knew before, they go
But this dream is the life I've been searching for
Started believing that I was the greatest
My life was never gonna be the same
Cause with the money came a different status
That's when things change
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

[Refrain]
You might also like[Couplet 2]
I never used to be a troublemaker
Now I don't even wanna please the fans
No autographs, no interviews, no pictures
And list demands
Given advice that was clearly wrong
The type that seems to make me feel so right
But some things you may find can take over your life
Burnt all my bridges, now I've run out of places
And there's nowhere left for me to turn
Been caught in compromising situations
I should have learned
From all those times I didn't walk away
When I knew that it was best to go
Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart ?

[Refrain]

[Pont]
Now I know I made mistakes
Think I don't care
But you don't realize what this means to me
So let me have just one more chance
I'm not the man I used to be
Use to be
[Refrain] x3

Get a dose once, you gon' want some more
My tongue touch ya girl, ya toes bound to curl
This exclusive stick I don't share with the world,
I have you up early in the mornin, moanin
Back shot, proper or low can't stop us
Been a fiend for this since Rakim made hits
Get the position down pat, then it's time to switch
I'll rock the boat, I'll work the middle
I speed it up, straight beat it up
.. and I ain't in the hood with my toast out loc'n
I'm in the telly workin up a sweat strokin
Tonight's the night, you can fall in love
You can call your mama right now, tell her you met a thug
I pop a lot of shit cause I can back it up
My left stroke's the death stroke

That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight
[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back

[Bridge: Ludacris]
Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Damn right, the fire marshal wanna shut us down
Get us out, so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from getting some cut up
Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Move over; Luda got something to say
Do it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today
Work with me, let's become one with the beat
And don't worry about me stepping all over your feet
[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back

[Outro: Ludacris & Shawnna]

Bomb ass pussy
Ma, ooh you got that bomb, know you got it
Ma, ooh you got some bomb ass pussy
Ma I know you got that bomb bomb pussy

[Hook: Snoop/Chingy + Girl]
(Whachu doing?) Nothing chilling at the Holiday Inn!
(Who you with?) Me and my peeps thought you'd bring over your friends
(What we gon' do?) Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin
(Whachu doing?) Nothing chilling at the Holiday Inn!
(Who you with?) Me and my peeps thought you'd bring over your friends
(What we gon' do?) Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin

[Verse 1: Chingy]
Peeps call me up [phone ring] said it's a ho-tel party
Just bring the liquor, there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way, let me stop by the store
Get a 12-pack of Coronas - plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Rd
I'm already blowed, hit third I'mma be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet looking like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
It's three girls on the elevator like: "wassup?"
I told em: "follow me". they knew I had it cracking B
One said "ain't you that boy that be on BET?"
"Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped with much ding-a-ling"
Knock on the door, I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face
Fuck it then, feel like my head is toxic waste
It's some pretty girls in hurr, I heard em whispering
Talking bout "that's that dude that sing "Right Thurr" - he glistening"
I ain't come to talk, I ain't come to sit
What I came for was to find out who I'm gonna hit, aww shit

[Verse 2: Chingy]
Ma showed up like "what's the hold up?"
Man know what, get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, acting silly
The girl said "can I be in yo video" I'm like "yeah!", "oh really?"
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage as I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wilding
Sharing the next room with some girls looking like they from an island

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on your nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle
Got 'em under control, with a bowl of Tender Vittles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little "D" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not Wiffle
Hit 'em in triples, with no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, with a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm with Chingy, at the Holiday Inn

[Hook]
(Whachu doing?) Nothing chilling at the Holiday Inn!

Yeah, let the party begin, bitch
Ching-a-ling Ling, all the way in St. Louis
My nigga Chingy, Disturbing Tha Peace
Luda, Luda, going hard on you hoes
Yeah bitch, bring four of ya friends
Meet me at the Holiday Inn
Bring a gang of that Hen, some VSOP
Ooh wee! And light that sticky-icky
And we gone do the damn thing
Now what I'm talking bout
We gonna disturb the peace right now
Yeah we ain't doing nothing but chillin
We chillin' and nuttin'
Know what I'm talking bout, so push the button
You know what's happenin', fa shizzle

Mandy by Westlife

9 ContributorsMandy Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into
Morning just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me

[Chorus]
Oh Mandy
When you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
When you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

[Verse 2]
I'm standing on the edge of time
I walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing
Tears are on my mind
Nothing is rhyming

So full of sparkle and such light
Let me remind
You chose not to cry
It's all right
For your lover has come home
By your side I'll always stay
Never have to be alone

And in your arms
Together we're in paradise

Put That Woman First by Jaheim

10 ContributorsPut That Woman First Lyrics[Intro]
Ooooh, ooh, whoo, whoo, ooh (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
If they gleam in the sun
While they spin and they fit on my truck then (​​I could remember)
And if it came in the sack
No stems no seeds in the bag girl (I could remember)
And if they drip from my wrist and they look like they shine like new then
{​​I could remember}​​
But ohhh, girl
I forgot to be your lover
If it wasn't for the 9 to 5
Double-up overtime then (​​I could remember)
If it wasn't for the Sunday All-Star Weekend games, girl (I could remember)
And if it wasn't for the dough
Gettin' 50 G's a show, girl, ya know that (I could remember)
But silly me, silly me
Ohhhh
Tell me how could I ever forget to be your lover
Now I realize that you need love too (Oh, yeah)
Spend my life makin' love to you
Oh, girl
Oh, I forgot to be your lover

[Chorus]
When she starts bringin' up old dirt
And the fights keep getting worse (Oh, brother)
Findin' numbers in her purse
Better put that woman first (Yeah)
And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Oh, no)
When she starts playin' little games
Comin' in late from work
You better put that woman first
You might also like[Verse 2]
If it wasn't for the make up on my shirt
Still I'd be chasin' skirts then (​​I could remember)
And if it wasn't for that fight last night
You smashin' out my headlights then (​​I could remember)
If it wasn't for parole
Steady duckin' my P O girl you know (​​I could remember)
But silly me, silly me, babe
Tell me how could I ever forget to be your lover
Now I realize that you need love too
Spend my life makin' love to you
Oh, girl
Oh, I forgot to be your lover

[Chorus]
When she starts bringin' up old dirt (Bringin' up old shhhh)
And the fights keep getting worse
(Oh...oh...oh...oh...)
Findin' numbers in her purse (I'm tellin' you, brother)
Better put that woman first (You better put your woman first)
And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Oh, yeah)
When she starts playin' little games (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm tellin' you, brother)
Comin' in late from work
You better put that woman first (Put that woman first)

[Bridge]
{​​So many times}​​ Actin like it wasn't really nothin'
{​​So many ways}​​ Kept to myself, always runnin'
{​​So many games}​​ All that I sin
{​​So many words}​​ I need you to stay
{​​Always came first}​​ Even though sometimes fallin'
Second
{​​Came down to love}​​ You know I had to win the last race
{​​Spend some time}​​ Put in some work
{​​And for better or worse}​​ Always put that woman first
[Chorus]
When she starts bringin' up old dirt
And the fights keep getting worse (Gettin' worse)
Findin' numbers in her purse (In her purse)
Better put that woman first (Put that woman first)
And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Ooh, yeah)
When she starts playin' little games (Her little games)
Comin' in late from work (I'mma say it again)
You better put that woman first (Put that woman, put that woman first)
When she starts bringin' up old dirt
And the fights keep getting worse (She's gonna leave you)
Findin' numbers in her purse
Better put that woman first (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When she starts playin' little games (Yeah, yeah)
Comin' in late from work
You better put that woman first5Embed

Gossip Folks (feat. Ludacris) by Missy Elliott, Ludacris

61 ContributorsGossip Folks Lyrics[Intro]
Yo, yo yo move out of the way
We got Missy Elliott coming through
Girl, that is Missy Elliott she lost a lot of weight
I heard she eat one cracker a day
Girl, well I heard the bitch was married to Tim' and started fuckin' with Trina
I heard the bitch got hit by three zebras and a monkey
I can't stand the bitch no way

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
When I walk up in the piece
I ain't gotta even speak
I'm a bad mamajama
Goddammit, motherfucker, you ain't gotta like me
How you stuntin' these hoes?
Need to talk, what you know
And stop talkin' 'bout who I'm stickin' and lickin'
Just mad it ain't yours
I know y'all poor, y'all broke
Y'all job just hangin' up clothes
Step to me, get burnt like toast
Motherfuckers, adios, amigos
Hop, hop, pose, pose
I don't brag, I mostly boast
From the VA to the LA coast
Izzo kizzay, lezzy goh

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
When I pull up in my whip
Bitches wanna talk shit
I'm drivin', I'm glidin', I'm stylin'
And these motherfuckers ask, "Did you see it?"
I'm grippin' these curbs
Skrrt, did ya heard?
I love 'em, my feathers, my furs, ahh
I fly like a bird
Chickenheads on the prowl
Who you tryna **** now?
Now you ain't gettin' loud
Better calm down 'fore I smack your ass down
I need my drums, bass, high hat
Has to be my snare, strings, horns, yes
I need my Tim' sound, right, left
Izzo kizzay, looky here
[Chorus]

[Bridge: Missy]
I don't go out my house, shorty, you just waitin' to see
Who I’m gon' roll up in the club with then report that next week
Just wanna see who I am ****, boy sniffing some coke
I know by the time I finish this line, I'ma hear this on the radio

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind, no one gave a shit
Knowin' he could rap, no one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
Fifty thousand sold, seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone, three years later
Stepped out the swamp in ten-and-a-half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smellin' like Burberry cologne
Still ridin' chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen, never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect, you'll give me
Ludacris, I live loud like Timmay (Uh)
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache, and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head tucked tight
Sprayed, so I never let the bedbugs bite
Hard to the core, core to the rotten
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Yahh!
[Chorus]
Millze cillzan sillzome plilzay dilzzouble dilzutch
Hilzzoo?

Izzo kizzay
Izzall rizzight
Izzo kizzay
Izzall rizzight! Nizzow wizzee wilzzo-izzo-zee
[Outro Skit]
Yo, straight up Missy killed that shit tonight for real
I know, I know, I don't really care about her being pregnant by Michael Jackson
You know what we should do?
We should go get her album when it come out
There she go, there she go, there she—
Hi Missy
Hi Missy?
What's up fools?
You think I ain't knowin y'all broke, Milli Vanilli
J.J. Fad wannabes ain't over here gossipin' 'bout me?
Yo, how bout you buff these Pumas for twenty cents
So your lights won't get cut off
You soggy breasts, cow stomachs
Yo, take those baby GAP shirts off, too
You just mad 'cause Payless ran outa plastic pumps for the after party
Yo, by the way, go get my album
Damn

Calling All Angels by Train

13 ContributorsCalling All Angels Lyrics[Verse 1]
I need a sign to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
When there is no place safe
And no safe place to put my head
When you can feel the world shake
From the words that are said

[Hook]
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

[Refrain]
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up

[Verse 2]
I need a sign to let me know you're here
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear
I want a reason for the way things have to be
I need a hand to help build up
Some kind of hope inside of me
See Train LiveGet tickets as low as $57You might also like[Hook]
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

[Bridge]
When children have to play inside
So they don't disappear
While private eyes solve marriage lies
'Cause we don't talk for years
And football teams are kissing queens (I won't give up if you don't give up)
And losing sight of having dreams
In a world that what we want (I won't give up if you don't give up)
Is only what we want until it's ours

[Hook]
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

[Outro]
And I'm calling all angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
And I'm calling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
Calling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)
Calling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)
Calling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)9Embed

Miss Independent by Kelly Clarkson

23 ContributorsMiss Independent Lyrics[Verse 1]
Miss independent
Miss self-sufficient
Miss keep your distance, mmm
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
Said, ooh, she fell in love

[Chorus]
What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

Misguided heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection
She fell in love

[Chorus]
What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Open this door)
Surprise, it's time (Yeah)
To feel what's real, what's real
What happened to Miss Independent? (Oh)
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you (Old you)
When love, when love is true

[Bridge]
When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of "Why can't that be me?"
I'm so glad I finally see
[Chorus]
What is this feelin' taking over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Oh yeah)
Surprise (Surprise), it's time (Yeah)
To feel (To feel) what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive (Yeah)
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you
When love, when love is true

Come Undone by Robbie Williams

18 ContributorsCome Undone Lyrics[Verse 1]
So unimpressed but so in awe
Such a saint but such a whore
So self aware, so full of shit
So indecisive, so adamant

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm contemplating, thinking about thinking
It's overrated, just get another drink and

[Chorus]
Watch me come undone
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum
And I'm your son
I come undone
I come undone

[Verse 2]
So rock 'n roll, so corporate suit
So damn ugly, so damn cute
So well-trained, so animal
So need-your-love, so fuck-you-all
See Robbie Williams LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm not scared of dying, I just don't want to
If I stopped lying, I'd just disappoint you

[Chorus]
I come undone
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum
And I'm your son
I come undone

[Bridge]
So write another ballad
Mix it on a Wednesday
Sell it on a Thursday
Buy a yacht by Saturday
It's a love song
A love song
Do another interview
Sing a bunch of lies
Tell about celebrities that I despise
And sing love songs
We sing love songs
So sincere
So sincere
[Chorus]
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
The young pretend you're in the clouds above the sea
I've come undone
I am scum
Love your son
You've gotta love your son
You've gotta love your son1Embed

Excuse Me Miss by JAY-Z

85 ContributorsExcuse Me Miss Lyrics[Intro/Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
You can't roll a blunt to this one
You gotta, you gotta well, ya gotta light a J
You gotta puff a J on this one [inhales]
You can't even drink Crist-OWL on this one
You gotta drink Crist-ALL
Buy some red wine, a little Gaja 9-7
You're so contagious, I can't take it
This is for the grown and sexy, uhh
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name? Ooh, oh
Yeah, can I get my grown man on for one second?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be hanging with Jay-Z, Jay-Z
So hot to trot, lady!
Excuse me miss, what's your name?
Can you come, hang with me? (Ooh, oh)
Possibly, can I take you out, tonight?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You already know what it's hittin' for
Ma, I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin' on
50/50 venture with them S Dots kickin' off
Armadale poppin' now, only bring a nigga more
Only thing missin' is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards up, ALL TRUST
Who else you gon' run with? The truth is us
Only dudes movin' units - Em, Pimp Juice and us,
It's the Roc in here!
Maybach outside, got rocks in ears
PJ's on the runway, Young got air
I don't land at an airport, I call it the clearport
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more
Back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!
You might also like[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Sexcuse me... damn!
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
I got my Gaja 9-7 on right now
Lady
You gotta puff a J to this one
Can't roll a blunt up to this one boy
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name? Ooh, oh (AOWW!)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be rollin' wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z
So hot to trot, lady, what's your name? Ooh, oh
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be rollin' wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z
You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Everybody's like, "He's no item! Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!"
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in The Matrix
But fuck it, let the Fishburne
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Sex-cuse me, damn!
You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
You might go, you mighta gotta go get you some Scooby Doo's
Lady
Gotta throw on ya Scooby Doo's; those are shoes by the way
You're so contagious, I can't take it

Woo, yeah
It's 50 AKA Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of livin' to do 'fore I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it

You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'

[Verse 1]
You ain't a friend of mine (Yeah!), you ain't no kin of mine (C'mon!)
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with a .9? (Uh-huh)
We do this all the time (What?), right now we on the grind (Yeah)
So hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nicks and dimes (Uh-huh)
Shorty, she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind (Woo)
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine

She look good, but I know she after my cheddar

By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
When you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat

Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh?

Sound Of The Underground by Girls Aloud

21 ContributorsSound of the Underground Lyrics[Verse 1]
Disco dancin' with the lights down low
Beats are pumpin' on my stereo
Neighbour's bangin' on the bathroom wall
You're sayin', "Crank the bass, I gotta get some more"

[Refrain]
Water's runnin' in the wrong direction
Got a feelin' it's a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Something funny's goin' on inside my mind
Don't know what is pushin' me higher
It's the static from the floor below
And then it drops and catches like a fire
It's a sound I, it's a sound I know

[Chorus]
It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes 'round and 'round
Into to the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
The beat goes around and 'round
It's the sound of the under, sound of the underground

Chain reaction runnin' through my veins
Pumps the bass line up into my brain
Screws my mind until I lose control
And when the building rocks, I know it's got my soul

Got a feelin' it's a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflection

Love is life and life is living
It's very special
All my love…
Oh-oh-oh
Uh, baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Very special
Baby, don't go, uh
All my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
I understand, just chillin'
Baby, don't go, yeah, yeah
Why you actin' like that?

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
It's such a shame, but I'm leaving (Uh)
Can't take the way you mistreated me (Uh)
And it's crazy, but oh, baby (Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh)
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (What you want, baby?)
I gotta leave you alone (Come on now)
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block (Don't go, baby)
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right? (Come on, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you (Uh, uh, uh)
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town (Creepin')
I thought my tender touch could lock you down (Yeah)
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now (Come here)
Stop playing (Haha, aw), you gaming
I gotta leave you alone (What you want now?)
[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
'Cause I'm good holding my spot
Stop acting like that
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
Now you know you need to stop
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?
Here we go

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad

I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 3: LL Cool J & Jennifer Lopez]
People make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
Cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me, you love me (Oh)
I'm like your homie, instead of beefin', come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony, don't bounce, baby, console me (Come here)
Ain't nothing you can say to me that
Can change my mind, I got to let you go now (Chill, baby)
And nothing will ever be the same, so just (Yeah)
Be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now (Baby, don't go)
And there's no more to explain to me, you know (Come on, now)
I know your game and I'm not feeling what you do (Come on, now)
So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (Don't bounce)
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah (Don't bounce, don't bounce, baby)

But baby, since you've gone
I admit that I was wrong

I'm here just like I said
Though it's breaking every rule I've ever made
My racing heart is just the same
Why make it strong to break it once again?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'd love to say I do
Give everything to you
But I can never now be true so I say

[Chorus]
I think I better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I better leave right now
Feeling weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now

[Verse 3]
I'm here so please explain
Why you're opening up a healing wound again
I'm a little more careful
Perhaps it shows
But if I lose the highs at least I'm spared the lows

Once bitten twice is shy

Why Don't You & I (feat. Chad Kroeger) by Santana, Chad Kroeger

11 ContributorsWhy Don’t You & I Lyrics[Verse 1: Chad Kroeger]
Since the moment I spotted you
Like walking 'round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
But every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
So I'll say, "Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again"
So I say, "Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in"

[Verse 2: Chad Kroeger]
When's this fever gonna break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh

So I say, "Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in"

[Bridge: Chad Kroeger]
Slowly, I begin to realize, this is never gonna end
Right about the same time you walk by
And I say, "Oh, here we go again, oh"

[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
So I'll say, "Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again"
So I say, "Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in"
[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
So I'll say, "Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again"
So I say, "Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in"4Embed

If You're Not The One by Daniel Bedingfield

21 ContributorsIf You’re Not the One Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you're not the one, then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one, then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine, then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine, would I have the strength to stand at all?

[Pre-Chorus]
I never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

[Chorus]
I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?

[Verse 2]
If I don't need you, then why am I cryin' on my bed?
If I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me, then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me, then why do I dream of you as my wife?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I'm praying you're the one I build my home with
I hope I love you all my life

I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?

[Bridge]
'Cause I miss you
Body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you
Into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
'Cause I love you
Whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
You know my heart is by your side

[Chorus]
I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?2Embed

Rain On Me by Ashanti

(Drum)
(Gong)
Hahaha!


[Verse 1]
I'm looking in the mirror at this woman, down and out
She's internally dying and knew this was not what love's about
I don't wanna be this woman the second time around
'Cause I'm waking up, screaming, no longer believing that I'm gonna be around
[Pre-Chorus]
And over and over I tried, yet over and over, you lied
And over and over I cried, I don't know why
And over and over I tried, yet over and over, you lied
Over and over I cried, I don't know why

[Chorus]
Rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe
Baby, just rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe, babe

[Verse 2]
See, I don't wanna hug my pillow late at night no more
I'm tossing and turning and thinking 'bout burning down these walls
I don't wanna fuel this fire no more, no more, no more
See, I made up my mind 'cause I've wasted my time
Ain't nothing here to keep me warm

And over and over I cried, I don't know why
And over and over I tried, yet over and over, you lied
Over and over I cried, I cried, I cried, I cried

[Chorus]
Rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe
Baby, just rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe, babe

[Bridge]
I'm so tired of the rain in my life
And I'm so tired of the strain and now you're gonna lie
'Cause sometimes, I can't sleep at night and
This here, it just don't seem right and
Sometimes, I just wonder why I
Almost let my life go by
Sometimes, I can't sleep at night and
This here, it just don't seem right and
Sometimes, I just wonder why I
Almost let my life go by
[Chorus]
Rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe
Baby, just rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
Said I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live
Rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe
Baby, just rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me?
And I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live12Embed
